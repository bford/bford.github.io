<p>I'm now a proud first-time homeowner of a wee little place in Cambridge,
Massachusetts!
<p>It's the second-floor condo in this cute old-style building near Inman
Square:

<p>Of course, indoor shots in a small place are really difficult without
a good wide-angle lens, which I don't have unfortunately, but here are

<br>The Living Room.&nbsp; That's my dad on the futon.

<br>The Kitchen.&nbsp; Yep, that's a piano on the right.&nbsp; I know,

place. :-)
<p>Unfortunately, none of the bedroom or study shots I've taken so far
have worked out at all.
