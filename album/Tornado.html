"The Great Salt Lake City Tornado of '99"</h1></center>

<center>OK, so it was pretty wimpy as far as tornados go compared with
those in other areas, but it was sort of a novelty here.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
I wasn't in the area when it hit, so I missed most of the fun; however,
I did get in on some of the aftermath on the way home.&nbsp; The tornado
passed just to the east of my house, so we didn't get any damage at all
(although our yard did catch a few pieces of some less fortunate houses).

<br>Capitol Hill was hit hard...

<br>Yes indeed, this is the sad state of Utah.

<br>Now do you really want a Mansion on the Hilltop?
