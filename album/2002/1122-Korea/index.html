<p><b>First Weekend: Daegu</b>

<p><a href="donghwasa-full.jpg"><img src="donghwasa.jpg" alt="Donghwasa Temple Temple, Mt. Palgongsan"></a>
<br>
Despite my jet lag,
we managed to get out and see Donghwasa Temple in Mt. Palgongsan,
just north of Daegu.

Home to a huge standing Buddha in a courtyard
built into the side of the mountain.

A view from some of the hiking trails on Mt. Palgongsan near the temple.
<br>No, Buddhist monks aren't Nazis.
It's a <i>reverse</i> swastika,
so maybe they're the exact opposite... "Antinazis?"

<p>
Later, exploring the city on my own...

<p><b>Second Weekend: Andong</b>

<p>
About an hour's bus ride north of Daegu.

On the way to Musil Folk Villiage we found
a cool park full of weird abstract modern art,
with a cute little gazebo overlooking it all.

Unfortunately much of the actual village was in shadow
by the time we got there.<br>
But we did get to watch some folks working on re-thatching the roofs!

<td width="200">
<p>Sunday's main trek:<br>
We took a bus out to a nearby town,
and then hiked several miles through the mountains
along a lovely narrow winding road,
to visit Korea's largest Ginkgo tree.<br>
It was transplanted to this location (Yonggieri)
to keep it from being destroyed
by the construction of a dam nearby.

<p>Some nice local folks,
who we couldn't actually talk with due to language difficulties,
gave us a lift a short ways on the trip out,
and then some others later drove us almost all the way back to town.<br>
We were quite thankful,
because the bus ride and the hike out took longer than we expected
and it was already getting dark by the time we started heading back.

<p>(OK, maybe we were just foolish -
but we <i>had</i> to see that tree!!)

<p><b>Third Weekend: Pusan</b>

<p>Korea's main port city, about an hour and a half train ride south of Daegu.

<p><b>Saturday:</b>
The Pusan Aquarium is this amazingly cool waterfront building -
built almost entirely <i>under</i> the beach.
The entrance just looks like a small visitor's center sitting on the beach,
but you go down an escalator and there are
several levels of cool aquarium stuff below the water line...

<br>It was dark when we got out of the aquarium,
so we took a quiet walk through nearby Dongbaek Park
where we met some new furry friends.

<b>Sunday</b>:
It turned out wet and rainy all day,
so what better time to go out slogging through the mud
at a mostly-outdoor botanical garden?
<br>(Geumgang Park, in Dongnae-gu)

<p>

a temple and war memorial to the Korean heroes
of the resistance against the Japanese invasions.
