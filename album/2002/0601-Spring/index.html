<h1>Spring</h1>
<h2>(June 1-8, 2002)</h2>

<p>
Spring is not just a season,
but also a wonderful yearly week-long campout in New Hampshire
organized by some friends of mine!
I was having too much fun there to remember to take many pictures,
but here are a few.
There should be more soon at
<a href="http://www.moonshadowdesign.com/spring/">the camp's official site</a>.

beautiful, skin-numbingly cold, and C.O. of course!
