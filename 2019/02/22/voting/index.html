      <h1>The Remote Voting Minefield: from North Carolina to Switzerland</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/mark-harris-nc-voter-fraud.html">absentee ballot fraud in North Carolina</a>
shows how current vote-by-mail methods are fundamentally flawed and vulnerable
to vote-buying and coercion. But banning remote voting of any kind would
disenfranchise everyone not living in their country of citizenship; that is not
a real option.</p>

<p>It is important to understand in this light the context of the Swiss e-voting
project, one of whose two implementations was <a href="https://onlinevote-pit.ch/details/">recently opened to public
inspection</a> by the Swiss Post for inspection
and analysis by international experts.
Almost everyone in Switzerland votes by mail.  Despite its well-known
vulnerability to fraud, coercion, or vote-buying of exactly the kind we see in
North Carolina, Switzerland <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1662-6370.2007.tb00075.x">adopted postal
voting</a>
from 1978 to 2006 for voter convenience and engagement.</p>

<p>Due to its <a href="https://houseofswitzerland.org/swissstories/history/way-modern-direct-democracy-switzerland">tradition of direct
democracy</a>,
Switzerland asks citizens to vote four times per year, not just once in 2-4
years as in the US.  If you’re asking people to read up on and vote on dozens
of issues several times a year, it had better be convenient.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the expat issue. Swiss citizens living abroad, even in neighboring
European countries, don’t get voting rights there like moving to another state
in the US. <a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/living-abroad/publications-statistics/statistics.html">About 11% for Swiss citizens live
abroad</a>,
in contrast to more like 3% of US citizens.
<a href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/population.html">Switzerland&rsquo;s
population</a> is
similar to New York City&rsquo;s. If Switzerland disallowed remote voting, it would
be like NYC disenfranchising any New Yorker who moves elsewhere until they
spend 10 years establishing new citizenship in Jersey or Upstate New York.</p>

<p>Taking a position of &ldquo;no remote voting&rdquo; in a small country like Switzerland
would be not just unrealistic but flat-out undemocratic.  Given this reality,
the Swiss voting authorities have the challenging and unenviable task of
navigating a minefield of imperfect alternatives.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20132343/index.html">regulation and design
level</a>,
the Swiss E-voting project is the most technically solid I&rsquo;ve seen anywhere,
mandating end-to-end encryption and universal verifiability all the way from
vote entry through shuffling and counting in the split-trust back-end.
Another important distinction of Switzerland&rsquo;s approach is its requirement that
&ldquo;<a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20132343/index.html#a7a">the source code for the system software must be made
public</a>&rdquo; &mdash;
a huge advance over the standard practice of governments almost anywhere else
in the world.</p>

<p>No system meeting these requirements can realistically be expected to be
simple. Now that the source code for one of the two independent implementations
has been published, it&rsquo;s no surprise that experts are <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbwz94/experts-find-serious-problems-with-switzerlands-online-voting-system-before-public-penetration-test-even-begins">finding issues and
worrying about its
complexity</a>.
But that is the whole point of the carefully-regulated,
open approach
Switzerland is taking: to find flaws, fix them, iteratively improve design and
implementation practices, and deploy E-voting cautiously and gradually among
limited populations in participating cantons.</p>

<p>Those who oppose any E-voting due to its complexity fail to consider how
alternative methods of remote voting may be even worse.  Postal voting puts the
entire complex and opaque postal mail system, with all its workers and
automated mail-handling systems, on the trusted path.
Properly-designed E-voting can enable voters to verify independently that their
vote was correctly conveyed to the voting authority and not lost (or &ldquo;lost&rdquo; by
a miscreant) and that it was shuffled and tallied correctly, without trusting
any single human or electronic device.
The &ldquo;average voter&rdquo; certainly won&rsquo;t understand all the code and cryptography in
an E-voting system. But if the source code is open to public inspection,
any voter can find or hire an
expert of their choice to analyze it. Will your postal service let you send
your choice of expert to inspect their operation?</p>

<p>International scrutiny of E-voting systems like Switzerland&rsquo;s is extremely
important and welcome. But simplistically opposing all E-voting, on grounds of
complexity or failure to solve problems like vote-buying that alternatives like
postal voting have too, is counterproductive.
The only way to solve critical open security challenges like vote-buying is to
press forward and work to advance the state-of-the-art further, not retreat to
a techno-luddist position that any voting method using paper is automatically
more secure than any method using electrons.</p>

<p>Estonia&rsquo;s approach of <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ff4d/0a77e7561e62fd0258280c0baa02d8256a03.pdf">allowing
&ldquo;re-voting&rdquo;</a>,
where a voter who cast a vote under coercion can later replace it with
different vote when no longer under coercion, has its flaws but is pointing in
the right direction.  The idea of &ldquo;decoy ballots&rdquo; in Chaum&rsquo;s recent proposal of
<a href="https://rsvoting.org">Random Sample Voting</a> and its derivative
<a href="https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/inst-infsec/information-security-group-dam/research/publications/pub2018/Alethea_CSF18_BasinRadomirovicSchmid.pdf">Alethea</a>
is also an important and interesting idea that&rsquo;s definitely pointing in the
right direction, if not yet a perfect solution either.</p>

<p>Highly-mobile citizens of modern democracies need the ability to vote
conveniently, from outside their home town or country when necessary. Just
saying that no remote voting technology is safe may be simplistically true but
is unhelpful. No voting technology is perfectly safe.  We can prevent future
disasters like North Carolina only facing forward, not back. A
technically-informed, systematically-designed, cautiously-deployed, open
approach like Switzerland&rsquo;s E-voting project is what tech security people need
to embrace and improve, not dogpile.</p>

<p>Updated 8-Mar-2019 to reflect that the Swiss Post code is
open to public inspection but not &ldquo;open source&rdquo; by
<a href="https://opensource.org/osd">standard definitions</a>.</p>

<p>Disclosure: my <a href="https://dedis.epfl.ch">DEDIS lab</a> at
<a href="https://www.epfl.ch">EPFL</a>
was recently involved in funded research collaboration with
one of the two Swiss E-voting implementation projects (<a
href="https://www.ge.ch/dossier/chvote-plateforme-vote-electronique-du-canton-geneve">CHVote
</a> from Geneva, not the Swiss Post project mentioned above). I am
not otherwise affiliated with either project.
