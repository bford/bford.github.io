      <h1>Rethinking Priorities: Should Identity Systems Divide or Unite People?</h1>

      <p><em>Note: this blog post was a brief sketch of ideas elaborated in
<a href="/pub/soc/personhood">a longer paper</a>
written later.</em></p>
<p>The problem of identity has become a hot topic,
with the idea of
<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">self-sovereign identity</a>
in particular attracting significant excitement.
The essence of the idea, in short,
is to <em>put users in charge</em> of how their identities and personal data are used.
Self-sovereign identity posits that users should decide
how much and what aspects of their identities to disclose in any situation,
and should know and have control over what that information is used for.</p>
<p>I have no argument with these basic goals.
The approaches to <em>achieving</em> them I&rsquo;ve seen, however,
start to run astray in the very next step.
Self-sovereign identity systems typically focus in practice
on representing an identity as a set of <em>attributes</em>
or <em>verifiable claims</em>
that users may &ldquo;prove&rdquo; about themselves to a relying party.
For example, the
<a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/specs.html">standardization effort around decentralized identity</a>
currently defines
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">decentralized identifiers</a>
as the &ldquo;base layer&rdquo;, and immediately atop that the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/">verifiable claims</a> layer
defining a rich taxonomy of personal information someone might want to know
about someone else.</p>
<p>A central presumption in this model appears to be that
the main purpose of a decentralized identity, and its main value,
should be to enable such distinctions through verifiable claims.
This implies by extension that a decentralized identity
without any attributes that a user can (or wishes to) claim
is effectively a useless, valueless, &ldquo;null&rdquo; identity.
But by single-mindedly focusing on <em>attributes</em>
as the primary use of an identity,
self-sovereign identity projects are pushing the cart before the horse.
They forgot even to ask, let alone adequately answer,
the question of who or what <em>the user</em> is
who is supposed to be put &ldquo;in control&rdquo; of their identity,
before seeking to facilitate discrimination <em>between</em> such users.</p>
<p>By rushing headlong toward
the goal of <em>differentiating</em> people from each other
via attributes and verifiable claims,
self-sovereign identity projects neglect
the even-more-fundamental requirement
to differentiating <em>people</em> from <em>non-people</em>.
Before we even begin to separate people from each other via attributes,
we need a way to separate the human users,
who are supposed to be in control of their identities,
from the many non-human entities such as devices, websites, businesses,
and governments, bots, AIs, and Sybils,
which often deliberately work against a user&rsquo;s control.
Dividing people from each other via attributes,
before uniting people in distinction
from the increasingly-powerful non-people in the ecosystem,
will work against and probably defeat
the basic eponymous objective of imbuing identity with &ldquo;self-sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a focus on attributes,
in order for a user to accomplish anything or use any service online,
the service will have to demand the user disclose at least enough attributes
for the service to be able to exclude trolls and abusers confidently.
But that will also typically be enough data to identify the user uniquely,
correlate that data with the user&rsquo;s other actions and data found online,
defeat the user&rsquo;s privacy through correlation attacks,
and effectively wrest control away from the user once again.
Provable attributes and verifiable claims
will remain tools of surveillance capitalism,
even if the user supposedly &ldquo;consents&rdquo; to revealing them,
typically by being coerced to do so
as a condition of using the service that claims to need the information.</p>
<p>A focus on attributes and verifiable claims
neglects to recognize the numerous uses that digital identity
could and should provide people <em>before disclosing a single attribute</em>.
Providing a mechanism for <a href="http://bford.info/pub/dec/pop-abs"><em>proof of personhood</em></a> &ndash;
enabling users to prove merely that
an identity uniquely represents a <em>real person</em>, and nothing more &ndash;
could by itself address a vast array of today&rsquo;s online abuse threats.
The online abuse threats that attribute-free proof-of-persionhood could address
include Sybil attackers, sock puppets, online ballot stuffing,
social reputation hacking through fake accounts,
the inconvenience of subjecting users to constant CAPTCHAs,
and the energy, re-centralization, and uneven stake distribution problems
of proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and other investment-proportional
foundations for decentralized systems, blockchains, or cryptocurrencies.
Perhaps most importantly,
secure proof-of-personhood would drastically reduce
the <em>need</em> for uses to disclose attributes online,
and the range of reasons (or excuses) that businesses or online services
could reasonably invoke to demand attribute disclosure.</p>
<p>In short,
attempting to solve online abuse and related problems
by making users disclose identity attributes or personal data
is privacy-invasive, often unreliable and easily hacked,
and exclusionary because many real people lack documentation
or established trust relationships with institutions or other people.
If we can succeed in building a proper <em>personhood foundation</em> for identity,
then atop that there will be legitimate uses for verifiable claims.
But in order to enable users to be truly &ldquo;self-sovereign&rdquo;,
we need to maximize the value they obtain from the online ecosystem
merely by <em>being people</em> while disclosing no other distinguishing attributes.</p>
<p>We need to ensure that <em>all real people</em> have a strong baseline
of rights and functionality readily available to them,
both to ensure that users often have a realistic and effective choice
to disclose nothing other than their personhood,
and to ensure that real people
with no documentation or trust relationships to prove in verifiable claims &ndash;
e.g., refugees, homeless, stateless, etc. &ndash; can be (and remain)
first-class citizens online.
The first and most important identity system design question
should not be what people can do <em>with</em> attributes,
but what they can do <em>without</em> attributes.</p>
<!--

= Attribute-centric or Person-centric Identity


Many of the most critical uses for "identity"
don't fundamentally care about attributes at all,
only personhood or accountability.
Attributes are only a poor-man's means to determine personhood
and achieve accountability.
Examples:
- decentralized collaboration platforms, social networks,
- voting and reputation systems
- coupon/opportunity systems
- permissionless blockchains and cryptocurrencies


Focusing on attributes first defeats the goals of privacy
and linkability control.
It takes smaller and smaller amounts of personal information, in practice,
to correlate information about anyone
with other aspects of their presence online.


Focusing on attributes first defeats the goal of self-sovereignty.

Coerced disclosure: self-sovereign won't be
if all businesses demand personal details as a condition for
using their "free" site or service.
