<H3>Abstract:</H3>
Software-Defined Networking offers the appeal of a simple, centralized
programming model for managing complex networks. However, challenges in
managing low-level details, such as setting up and maintaining correct and
efficient forwarding tables on distributed switches, often compromise this
conceptual simplicity. In this paper, we present Maple, a system that
simplifies SDN programming by (1) allowing a programmer to use a standard
programming language to design an arbitrary, centralized algorithm, which we
call an algorithmic policy, to decide the behaviors of an entire network, and
(2) providing an abstraction that the programmer-defined, centralized policy
runs, conceptually, &ldquo;afresh&rdquo; on every packet entering a network,
and hence is oblivious to the challenge of translating a high-level policy into
sets of rules on distributed individual switches. To implement algorithmic
policies efficiently, Maple includes not only a highly-efficient multicore
scheduler that can scale efficiently to controllers with 40+ cores, but more
importantly a novel tracing runtime optimizer that can automatically record
reusable policy decisions, offload work to switches when possible, and keep
switch flow tables up-to-date by dynamically tracing the dependency of policy
decisions on packet contents as well as the environment (system state).
Evaluations using real HP switches show that Maple optimizer reduces HTTP
connection time by a factor of 100 at high load. During simulated benchmarking,
Maple scheduler, when not running the optimizer, achieves a throughput of over
20 million new flow requests per second on a single machine, with 95-percentile
latency under 10 ms.
