<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<P>
Traditional Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) have not lived up to their promise
because there are too many ways to define PKIs, too many cryptographic
primitives to build them with, and too many administrative domains with
incompatible roots of trust. Alpaca is an authentication and authorization
framework that embraces PKI diversity by enabling one PKI to &ldquo;plug in&rdquo; another
PKI's credentials and cryptographic algorithms, allowing users of the latter to
authenticate themselves to services using the former using their existing,
unmodified certificates. Alpaca builds on Proof-Carrying Authorization (PCA),
expressing a credential as an explicit proof of a logical claim. Alpaca
generalizes PCA to express not only delegation policies but also the
cryptographic primitives, credential formats, and namespace structures needed
to use foreign credentials directly. To achieve this goal, Alpaca introduces a
method of creating and naming new principals which behave according to
arbitrary rules, a modular approach to logical axioms, and a domain-specific
language specialized for reasoning about authentication. We have implemented
Alpaca as a Python module that assists applications in generating proofs (e.g.,
in a client requesting access to a resource), and in verifying those proofs via
a compact 800-line TCB (e.g., in a server providing that resource). We present
examples demonstrating Alpaca's extensibility in scenarios involving
inter-organization PKI interoperability and secure remote PKI upgrade.
