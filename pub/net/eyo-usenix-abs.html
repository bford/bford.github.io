<H3>Abstract:</H3>
Users increasingly store data collections such as digital photographs on
multiple personal devices, each of which typically offers a storage management
interface oblivious to the contents of the userâ€™s other devices. As a result,
collections become disorganized and drift out of sync.

<p>
This paper presents Eyo, a novel personal storage system that provides <i>device
transparency</i>: a user can think in terms of &ldquo;file X&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;file X on
device Y&rdquo;, and will see the same set of files on all personal devices. Eyo
allows a user to view and manage the entire collection of objects from any of
their devices, even from disconnected devices and devices with too little
storage to hold all the object content. Eyo synchronizes these collections
across any network topology, including direct peer-to-peer links. Eyo provides
applications with a storage API with first-class access to object version
history in order to resolve update conflicts automatically.

<p>
Experiments with several applications using Eyo&mdash;media players, a photo editor,
a podcast manager, and an email interface&mdash;show that device transparency
requires only minor application changes, and matches the storage and bandwidth
capabilities of typical portable devices.
