<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p>
Users often wish to participate in online groups anonymously,
but misbehaving users may abuse this anonymity to
disrupt the group's communication.
Existing messaging protocols such as DC-nets leave groups
vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks,
Mix-nets are difficult to protect against
traffic analysis,
and accountable voting protocols
are unsuited to general anonymous messaging.

<p>
We present the first general messaging protocol
that offers provable anonymity with accountability
for moderate-size groups,
and efficiently handles unbalanced loads
where few members wish to transmit in a given round.
The N group members first cooperatively shuffle
an N&times;N matrix of pseudorandom seeds,
then use these seeds in N &ldquo;pre-planned&rdquo; DC-nets protocol runs.
Each DC-nets run transmits the variable-length bulk data
comprising one member's message,
using the minimum number of bits required for anonymity
under our attack model.
The protocol preserves message integrity
and one-to-one correspondence between members and messages,
makes denial-of-service attacks by members traceable to the culprit,
and efficiently handles large, unbalanced message loads.
A working prototype demonstrates the protocol's practicality
for anonymous messaging in groups of 40+ members.
