<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p>
The Internet's architecture,
designed in the days of large, stationary computers
tended by technically savvy and accountable administrators,
fails to meet the demands of
the emerging ubiquitous computing era.
Nontechnical users now routinely own multiple personal devices,
many of them mobile,
and need to share information securely among them
using interactive, delay-sensitive applications.
        
<p>
<i>Unmanaged Internet Architecture</i> (UIA)
is a novel, incrementally deployable network architecture
for modern personal devices,
which reconsiders three architectural cornerstones:
naming, routing, and transport.
UIA augments the Internet's global name system
with a <i>personal name system</i>,
enabling users to build personal administrative groups
easily and intuitively,
to establish secure bindings between his devices
and with other users' devices,
and to name his devices and his friends
much like using a cell phone's address book.
To connect personal devices reliably,
even while mobile, behind NATs or firewalls,
or connected via isolated ad hoc networks,
UIA gives each device a persistent, location-independent <i>identity</i>,
and builds an <i>overlay routing service</i> atop IP
to resolve and route among these identities.
Finally, to support today's interactive applications
built using concurrent transactions and delay-sensitive media streams,
UIA introduces a new <i>structured stream</i> transport abstraction,
which solves the efficiency and responsiveness problems of TCP streams
and the functionality limitations of UDP datagrams. 

<p>
Preliminary protocol designs and implementations 
demonstrate UIA's features and benefits. 
A personal naming prototype
supports easy and portable group management,
allowing use of personal names alongside global names
in unmodified Internet applications.
A prototype overlay router leverages the naming layer's social network
to provide efficient ad hoc connectivity
in restricted but important common-case scenarios.
Simulations of more general routing protocols&mdash;one
inspired by distributed hash tables,
one based on recent compact routing theory&mdash;explore
promising generalizations to UIA's overlay routing.
A library-based prototype of UIA's structured stream transport
enables incremental deployment
in either OS infrastructure or applications,
and demonstrates the responsiveness benefits of the new transport abstraction
via dynamic prioritization of interactive web downloads.
Finally, an exposition and experimental evaluation of NAT traversal techniques
provides insight into routing optimizations useful in UIA and elsewhere.
