<h3>Abstract:</h3>
In RPC-based communication, it is useful to distinguish the RPC interface,
which is the “network contract” be- tween the client and the server, from the
presentation, which is the “programmer’s contract” between the RPC stubs and
the code that calls or is called by them. Presentation is usually a fixed
function of the RPC interface, but some RPC systems, such as DCE and Concert,
support the notion of a flexible presentation or endpoint modifier, allowing
controlled modification of the behavior of the stubs on each side without
affecting the contract between the client and the server.

<p>
Up until now, the primary motivation for flexible presentation has been for
programmer convenience and improved interoperability. However, we have found
flexible presentation also to be useful for optimization of RPC, and in many
cases necessary to achieving maximal performance without throwing out the RPC
system and resorting to hand-coded stubs. In this paper we provide examples
demonstrating this point for a number of different operating systems and IPC
transport mechanisms, with RPC performance improvements ranging from 5% to an
order of magnitude. In general, we observe that the more efficient the
underlying IPC transport mechanism is, the more important it is for the RPC
system to support flexible presentation, in order to avoid unnecessary
user-space overhead.
