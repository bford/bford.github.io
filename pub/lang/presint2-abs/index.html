<h3>Abstract:</h3>

In RPC-based communication, we term the <b>interface</b> the set of remote
procedures and the types of their arguments; the <b>presentation</b> is the way
these procedures and types are mapped to the target language environment in a
particular client or server, including semantic requirements. For example,
presentation includes the local names assigned to RPC stubs, the physical
representation of a logical block of data (e.g., in-line, out-of-line, linked
blocks), and trust requirements (e.g., integrity, security). In existing
systems, the presentation of a given RPC construct is largely fixed.

<p>
Separating presentation from interface, both in the interface definition
language (IDL) itself and in the RPC implementation, is the key to
<b>interoperability</b>, with many benefits in the area of elegance, as well.
This separation and resulting cleanliness makes it manageable to generate
specialized kernel code paths for each type of client-server pair. This is a
key element of <b>end-to-end optimization</b>. The separation should also allow
the integration of disparate RPC optimization techniques, such as those applied
in LRPC and fbufs, into a single system, in a uniform and fully interoperable
way. In initial work we demonstrate a variant of threaded code generation and
two presentation-based optimizations, transparently activated by the RPC
system. Each of these optimizations speeds up local RPC by approximately 25%.
