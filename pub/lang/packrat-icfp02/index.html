<h3>Abstract</h3>

Packrat parsing is a novel technique for implementing parsers
in a lazy functional programming language.
A packrat parser provides the power and flexibility
of top-down parsing with backtracking and unlimited lookahead,
but nevertheless guarantees linear parse time.
Any language defined by an LL(<i>k</i>) or LR(<i>k</i>) grammar
can be recognized by a packrat parser,
in addition to many languages
that conventional linear-time algorithms do not support.
This additional power
simplifies the handling of common syntactic idioms
such as the widespread but troublesome longest-match rule,
enables the use of sophisticated disambiguation strategies
such as syntactic and semantic predicates,
provides better grammar composition properties,
and allows lexical analysis to be integrated seamlessly into parsing.
Yet despite its power,
packrat parsing shares the same simplicity and elegance
as recursive descent parsing;
in fact
converting a backtracking recursive descent parser
into a linear-time packrat parser
often involves only a fairly straightforward structural change.
This paper describes packrat parsing informally
with emphasis on its use in practical applications,
and explores its advantages and disadvantages
with respect to the more conventional alternatives.

<h3>Example Parsers</h3>

Complete and working versions of the example parsers described in the paper
are available on this page.

<p>
<b><a href="ArithRecurse.hs">ArithRecurse.hs</a></b>:
Recursive descent parser described in Section 2.1,
for the trivial arithmetic expression language of Figure 1.

<p>
<b><a href="ArithPackrat.hs">ArithPackrat.hs</a></b>:
Equivalent packrat parser for the same trivial language,
Section 2.4.

<p>
<b><a href="ArithLeft.hs">ArithLeft.hs</a></b>:
Left recursion example for Section 3.1,
which extends the above packrat parser with
properly left-associative subraction, division, and modulo operators.

<p>
<b><a href="ArithLex.hs">ArithLex.hs</a></b>:
Integrated lexical analysis example for Section 3.2,
which extends the previous packrat parser
with support for multiple-digit decimal literals
and optional whitespace padding
between literals, operators, and punctuation.

<p>
<b><a href="ArithMonad.hs">ArithMonad.hs</a></b>:
Example packrat parser, equivalent to ArithPackrat.hs,
but using monadic combinators to express the parsing functions more succinctly
and provide support for user-friendly error detection and reporting.
Discussed in Section 3.3 of the paper.
The following two library modules are required:

<ul>
<li>	<a href="Pos.hs">Pos.hs</a>:
	Keeps track of line and column position while scanning input text.
<li>	<a href="Parse.hs">Parse.hs</a>:
	Monadic combinator library for packrat parsers,
	inspired by Daan Leijen's
	<a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html">Parsec</a> library.
	(Parsec was designed for traditional predictive parsers
	and mostly-predictive parsers with special-case backtracking.)
</ul>
