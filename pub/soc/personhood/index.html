<h3>Abstract:</h3>

Digital identity seems at first like a prerequisite for digital democracy:
how can we ensure &ldquo;one person, one vote&rdquo; online
without identifying voters?
But the full gamut of digital identity solutions &ndash;
e.g., online ID checking,
biometrics,
self-sovereign identity,
and social/trust networks &ndash;
all present severe flaws in security, privacy, and transparency,
leaving users vulnerable to exclusion, identity loss or theft,
and coercion.
These flaws may be insurmountable because
digital identity is a cart pulling the horse.
We cannot achieve digital identity
secure enough to support the weight of digital democracy,
until we can build it on a solid foundation of <em>digital personhood</em>
meeting key requirements.
While identity is
about distinguishing one person from another through attributes or affiliations,
personhood is about giving <em>all</em> real people inalienable digital
participation rights independent of identity,
including protection against erosion of their democratic rights
through identity loss, theft, coercion, or fakery.

<p>
We explore and analyze
alternative approaches to <em>proof of personhood</em>
that might provide this missing foundation.
<em>Pseudonym parties</em>
marry the transparency
of periodic physical-world roll-call events
with the convenience of digital tokens between events.
These tokens represent limited-term but renewable digital personhood claims,
usable for purposes such as
online voting or liquid democracy,
sampled juries or deliberative polls,
abuse-resistant social communication,
or minting universal basic income in a permissionless cryptocurrency.
Enhancing pseudonym parties to provide participants
a moment of enforced physical security and privacy
can address the coercion and vote-buying risks
that plague today's E-voting and postal voting systems alike.
We also examine other recently-proposed approaches to proof of personhood,
some of which offer conveniences such as all-online participation.
These alternatives currently fall short of
satisfying all the key digital personhood goals, unfortunately,
but offer valuable insights into the challenges we face.
