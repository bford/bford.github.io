<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>While technology is often claimed to be “democratizing”, the technologizing of
society has more often yielded undemocratic or even anti-democratic outcomes.
Is technology fundamentally at odds with democracy, or is it merely a rich and
infinitely-adaptable toolbox that we’re using the wrong way? We explore how
technology has failed to support robust democracy – but could do better – in
the context of four basic social processes: collective deliberation and choice,
information distribution and filtering, economic commerce, and identity.</p>
<p>Technology could eventually help us make better collective choices, but only if
we can make digital deliberation and voting systems both truly participatory
and truly secure. Since making good decisions relies on the availability of
good information, we need digital forums that enable communities to vet and
filter a digital deluge of information democratically without falling into a
muddle of fake news, real and perceived bias, or polarized echo chambers. Since
effective participations is impractical for those who must spend every moment
of time struggling to survive, healthy digital democracy will require a
democratic reformulation of digital-age money and commerce as well. Finally,
none of these social processes can resist abuse or subversion without a
democratic basis for digital identity that can distinguish real people from
abuse, botnets, and sock puppets, while preserving the privacy needed for
freedom and true self-expression. While this perspective leaves many questions
to answer and challenges to overcome, it does suggest a framework or layered
architecture we might take as a tentative blueprint for digital democracy.</p>
