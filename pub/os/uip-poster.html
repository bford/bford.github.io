<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
We are heading for a device information disaster. There are two clear
symptoms. First, many people have dozens of devices which store
information, but they are unable to organize and find that
information. A given picture might be on a digital camera, a home PC,
a laptop, an iPod Photo, or a cell phone. In many cases, knowing a
file's location is not enough, because the device in question is on
the far side of a firewall or not currently plugged into a PC's USB
port.

<p>
The second symptom is that each person's collection of information
devices is an isolated island.  People cannot easily share pictures,
documents, music, or videos with friends, family, or colleagues.
Today one must upload the information from a device to a personal
computer and then use e-mail, or transfer a file through a physical
medium such as a USB key.

<p>
These problems are due to the rapid progress in information
devices without a corresponding plan for global communication and
sharing.  The state of the art is local connectivity centered around a
single PC that functions as a server (USB, Apple's rendezvous,
uPNP). Only the PC can participate in global communication and sharing
across the Internet.  The information devices are not first-class
global citizens, even though they have PC-like communication and
storage capabilities.

<h2>The User Information Architecture</h2>

<p>
The User Information Architecture
is an extension to the Internet architecture
designed to allow global interaction
and sharing among ubiquitous information devices.
The UIA is based on two
principles:
(1) decoupling of device identification and communication security
from physical connectivity; and
(2) establishing device-to-device trust
based on user-to-user social relationships.
The decoupling
principle makes it safe to expose devices to the Internet,
because physical Internet attachment
no longer directly exposes the device's high-level application services
to arbitrary, unknown Internet hosts.
The social-networking principle provides a decentralized trust model
that is easily comprehensible to nontechnical users
and makes end-to-end cryptographic security
possible without needing a universal, centralized
public key infrastructure (PKI).

<p>
These principles lead to the following design of UIA:

<ul>
<li>
Each device has one or more global end-point IDs.
The IDs are derived from public keys,
and are therefore cryptographically verifiable.
They are the basic building
block for reliable identification of devices and principals.

<li>
If a physical device can be shared by multiple users,
then each user of the device has separate endpoint IDs,
so that an ID always verifiably identifies a unique logical principal
for purposes of communication security and social trust.

<li>
Each device runs the User Interconnect Protocol (UIP),
which allows a device to locate and connect to another device
given an endpoint ID.
UIP finds devices even if they are behind NATs or firewalls, or have moved,
requiring no manual re-configuration or management.

<li>
Each user of a device has an address book,
which records UIP IDs of other
devices and users with which it can communicate and share information.
Initially, the address book is populated by user-initiated physical
exchange of IDs between devices,
but address book entries remain usable and secure
even as devices migrate to different network attachment points.
Each entry in the address book
describes what privileges (if any) to grant the associated user.

<li>
A user's address book can delegate trust decisions to other
address books.  This mechanism allows a camera to serve pictures to
any device that the user's PC serves pictures to.  It also allows one
user's devices to connect and share with devices of trusted friends,
family, and colleagues, as well as their trusted friends, etc.
Delegation allows one to extend trust to groups of devices without
needing per-device configuration.

<li>
Each device participates in UIA's global, location-transparent data
storage system.  This system allows users to find their information,
independent of which devices store it.  The UIA data store replicates
and migrates data as needed. For example, it automatically backs up
camera pictures to the user's PC, to a friends's PC, or to a trusted
Internet provider's storage server.  The address books are stored in
the UIA storage system to allow users to use their devices without
relying on a home PC.
</ul>

<p>
We have developed a first-generation prototype of UIA,
which runs in user space on several popular operating systems,
and can provide secure communication for existing, unmodified applications
as well as applications designed specifically for UIA.
