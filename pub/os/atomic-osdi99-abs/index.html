<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<P>
We have defined and implemented a kernel API that makes every exported
operation fully interruptible and restartable, thereby appearing atomic to the
user. To achieve interruptibility, all possible kernel states in which a thread
may become blocked for a &ldquo;long&rdquo; time are represented as kernel
system calls, without requiring the kernel to retain any unexposable internal
state.

<p> Since all kernel operations appear atomic, services such as transparent
checkpointing and process migration that need access to the complete and
consistent state of a process can be implemented by ordinary user-mode
processes. Atomic operations also enable applications to provide reliability in
a more straightforward manner.

<p> This API also allows us to explore novel kernel implementation techniques
and to evaluate existing techniques. The Fluke kernel’s single source
implements either the &ldquo;process&rdquo; or the &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo;
execution model on both uniprocessors and multiprocessors, depending on a
configuration option affecting a small amount of code.

<p> We report preliminary measurements comparing fully, partially and
non-preemptible configurations of both process and interrupt model
implementations. We find that the interrupt model has a modest performance
advantage in some benchmarks, maximum preemption latency varies nearly three
orders of magnitude, average preemption latency varies by a factor of six, and
memory use favors the interrupt model as expected, but not by a large amount.
We find that the overhead for restarting the most costly kernel operation
ranges from 2–8% of the cost of the operation.
