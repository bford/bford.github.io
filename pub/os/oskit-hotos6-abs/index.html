<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<P>
To an unappreciated degree, research both in operating systems and their
programming languages has been severely hampered by the lack of cleanly
reusable code providing mundane low-level OS infrastructure such as bootstrap
code and device drivers. The Flux OS Toolkit solves this problem by providing a
set of clean, well-documented components. These components can be used as basic
building blocks both for operating systems and for booting language run-time
systems directly on the hardware. The toolkitâ€™s implementation itself
embodies reuse techniques by incorporating components such as device drivers,
file systems, and networking code, unchanged, from other sources. We believe
the kit also makes feasible the production of highly assured embedded and
operating systems: by enabling reuse of low-level code, the high cost of
detailed verification of that code can be amortized over many systems for
critical environments. The OS toolkit is already heavily used in several
different OS and programming language projects, and has already catalyzed
research and development that would otherwise never have been attempted.
