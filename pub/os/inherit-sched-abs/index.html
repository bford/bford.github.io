<H3>Abstract:</H3>
Traditional processor scheduling mechanisms in operating systems are fairly
rigid, often supporting only one fixed scheduling policy, or, at most, a few
&ldquo;scheduling classes&rdquo; whose implementations are closely tied
together in the OS kernel. This paper presents CPU inheritance scheduling, a
novel processor scheduling framework in which arbitrary threads can act as
schedulers for other threads. Widely different scheduling policies can be
implemented under the framework, and many different policies can coexist in a
single system, providing much greater scheduling flexibility. Modular,
hierarchical control can be provided over the processor utilization of
arbitrary administrative domains, such as processes, jobs, users, and groups,
and the CPU resources consumed can be accounted for and attributed accurately.
Applications, as well as the OS, can implement customized local scheduling
policies; the framework ensures that all the different policies work together
logically and predictably. As a side effect, the framework also cleanly
addresses priority inversion by providing a generalized form of priority
inheritance that automatically works within and among diverse scheduling
policies. CPU inheritance scheduling extends naturally to multiprocessors, and
supports processor management techniques such as processor affinity and
scheduler activations. We show that this flexibility can be provided with
acceptable overhead in typical environments, depending on factors such as
context switch speed and frequency.
