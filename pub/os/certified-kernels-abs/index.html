<H3>Abstract:</H3>

Operating System (OS) kernels form the bedrock of all system software&mdash;they can
have the greatest impact on the resilience, extensibility, and security of
today’s computing hosts. A single kernel bug can easily wreck the entire
system’s integrity and protection. We propose to apply new advances in
certified software to the development of a novel OS kernel. Our certified
kernel will offer safe and application-specific extensibility, provable
security properties with information flow control, and accountability and
recovery from hardware or application failures.

<p> Our certified kernel builds on proof-carrying code concepts, where a
binary executable includes a rigorous machine-checkable proof that the software
is free of bugs with respect to specific requirements. Unlike traditional
verification systems, our certified software approach uses an expressive
general-purpose meta-logic and machine-checkable proofs to support modular
reasoning about sophisticated invariants. The rich meta-logic enables us to
verify all kinds of low-level assembly and C code 
and to establish dependability claims ranging from simple safety properties to
advanced security, correctness, and liveness properties.

<p> We advocate a modular certification framework for kernel components, which
mirrors and enhances the modularity of the kernel itself. Using this framework,
we aim to create not just a &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; lump of verified kernel code, but a
statically and dynamically extensible kernel that can be incrementally built
and extended with individual certified modules, each of which will provably
preserve the kernel’s overall safety and security properties. In place of the
rigid safety conditions used in traditional extension mechanisms (e.g., that
kernel extensions must be type-safe), our approach will assure both the safety
and semantic correctness of extensions with respect to appropriate
specifications (e.g., that a file system extension behaves like a file system).
Our certified kernel will use this flexibility, for example, to provide
accountability and recovery mechanisms, formally guaranteeing that whenever an
application fails, the system can always be rolled back to an earlier,
consistent state. Our certified kernel will also provide information flow
control not only enforcing policies on user applications, but also
guaranteeing that the security monitor itself and other kernel modules
manipulate all security labels correctly.
