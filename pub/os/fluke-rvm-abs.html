<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<P>
This paper describes a novel approach to providing modular and extensible
operating system functionality and encapsulated environments based on a
synthesis of microkernel and virtual machine concepts. We have developed a
software-based virtualizable architecture called Fluke that allows recursive
virtual machines (virtual machines running on other virtual machines) to be
implemented efficiently by a microkernel running on generic hardware. A
complete virtual machine interface is provided at each level; efficiency
derives from needing to implement only new functionality at each level. This
infrastructure allows common OS functionality, such as process management,
demand paging, fault tolerance, and debugging support, to be provided by
cleanly modularized, independent, stackable virtual machine monitors,
implemented as user processes. It can also provide uncommon or unique OS
features, including the above features specialized for particular applications'
needs, virtual machines transparently distributed cross-node, or security
monitors that allow arbitrary untrusted binaries to be executed safely. Our
prototype implementation of this model indicates that it is practical to
modularize operating systems this way. Some types of virtual machine layers
impose almost no overhead at all, while others impose some overhead (typically
0-35%), but only on certain classes of applications.
