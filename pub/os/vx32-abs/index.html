<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<P>
Code sandboxing is useful for many purposes,
but most sandboxing techniques
require kernel modifications,
do not completely isolate guest code,
or incur substantial performance costs.
Vx32 is a multipurpose user-level sandbox
that enables any application
to load and safely execute one or more guest plug-ins,
confining each guest to a system call API controlled by the host application
and to a restricted memory region within the host&rsquo;s address space.
Vx32
runs guest code efficiently on several widespread operating systems
without kernel extensions or special privileges;
it protects the host program from both reads and writes by its guests;
and it allows the host to restrict the instruction set available to guests.
The key to vx32&rsquo;s combination of portability, flexibility, and efficiency
is its use of x86 segmentation hardware to sandbox the guest&rsquo;s data accesses,
along with a lightweight instruction translator
to sandbox guest instructions.</p>

<p>
We evaluate vx32 using microbenchmarks
and whole system benchmarks,
and we examine four applications based on vx32:
an archival storage system,
an extensible public-key infrastructure,
an experimental user-level operating system
running atop another host OS,
and a Linux system call jail.
The first three applications export
custom APIs independent of the host OS to their guests,
making their plug-ins binary-portable across host systems.
Compute-intensive workloads for the first two applications
exhibit between a 30&#37; slowdown and a 30&#37; <i>speedup</i>
on vx32 relative to native execution;
speedups result from vx32&rsquo;s instruction translator
improving the cache locality of guest code.
The experimental user-level operating system allows the use of
the guest OS&rsquo;s applications alongside
the host&rsquo;s native applications
and runs faster than whole-system virtual
machine monitors such as VMware and QEMU.
The Linux system call jail incurs up to 80&#37; overhead but
requires no kernel modifications and is delegation-based,
avoiding concurrency vulnerabilities present in
other interposition mechanisms.
