<H3>Abstract:</H3>
Timing side-channels
represent an insidious security challenge for cloud computing,
because:
(a) massive parallelism in the cloud
makes timing channels pervasive and hard to control;
(b) timing channels enable one customer to steal information from another
without leaving a trail or raising alarms;
(c) only the cloud provider can feasibly detect and report such attacks,
but the provider's incentives are <i>not</i> to; and
(d) resource partitioning schemes for timing channel control
undermine statistical sharing efficiency,
and, with it, the cloud computing business model.
We propose a new approach to timing channel control,
using <i>provider-enforced deterministic execution</i>
instead of resource partitioning
to eliminate timing channels within a shared cloud domain.
Provider-enforced determinism prevents execution timing
from affecting the results of a compute task, however large or parallel,
ensuring that a task's outputs leak no timing information
apart from explicit timing inputs and total compute duration.
Experiments with a prototype OS for deterministic cloud computing
suggest that such an approach may be practical and efficient.
The OS supports deterministic versions of familiar APIs
such as processes, threads, shared memory, and file systems,
and runs coarse-grained parallel tasks
as efficiently and scalably as
current timing channel-ridden systems.
