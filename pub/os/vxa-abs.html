<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<P>
Data compression algorithms change frequently,
and obsolete decoders
do not always run on new hardware and operating systems,
threatening the long-term usability
of content archived using those algorithms.
Re-encoding content into new formats is cumbersome,
and highly undesirable when lossy compression is involved.
Processor architectures,
in contrast,
have remained comparatively stable
over recent decades.
VXA, an archival storage system designed around this observation,
archives executable decoders along with the encoded content it stores.
VXA decoders run in a specialized virtual machine
that implements an OS-independent execution environment
based on the standard x86 architecture.
The VXA virtual machine strictly limits access
to host system services,
making decoders safe to run
even if an archive contains malicious code.
VXA's adoption of a ``native'' processor architecture
instead of type-safe language technology
allows reuse of existing ``hand-optimized'' decoders
in C and assembly language,
and permits decoders access to
performance-enhancing architecture features
such as vector processing instructions.
The performance cost of VXA's virtualization is typically less than 15%
compared with the same decoders running natively.
The storage cost of archived decoders,
typically 30-130KB each,
can be amortized across many archived files
sharing the same compression method.
