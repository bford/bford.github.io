<H3>Abstract:</H3>
Humanitarian action, the process of aiding individuals
in situations of crises, poses unique information-security
challenges due to natural or manmade disasters, the adverse
environments in which it takes place, and the scale and multidisciplinary
nature of the problems. Despite these challenges,
humanitarian organizations are transitioning towards a strong
reliance on the digitization of collected data and digital tools,
which improves their effectiveness but also exposes them to
computer-security threats. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative
analysis of the computer-security challenges of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a large humanitarian organization
with over sixteen thousand employees, an international
legal personality, which involves privileges and immunities, and
over 150 years of experience with armed conflicts and other
situations of violence worldwide. To investigate the computer
security needs and practices of the ICRC from an operational,
technical, legal, and managerial standpoint by considering individual,
organizational, and governmental levels, we interviewed
27 field workers, IT staff, lawyers, and managers. Our results
provide a first look at the unique security and privacy challenges
that humanitarian organizations face when collecting, processing,
transferring, and sharing data to enable humanitarian action for
a multitude of sensitive activities. These results highlight, among
other challenges, the trade-offs between operational security and
requirements stemming from all stakeholders, the legal barriers
for data sharing among jurisdictions; especially, the need to
complement privileges and immunities with robust technological
safeguards in order to avoid any leakages that might hinder
access and potentially compromise the neutrality, impartiality,
and independence of humanitarian action.
