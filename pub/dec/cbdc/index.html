<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p> Central banks around the world are exploring and in some cases even
piloting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs promise to realize a
broad range of new capabilities, including direct government disbursements to
citizens, frictionless consumer payment and money-transfer systems, and a range
of new financial instruments and monetary policy levers.

<p> CBDCs also give rise, however, to a host of challenging technical goals and
design questions that are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those
in existing government and consumer payment systems. A well-functioning CBDC
will require an extremely resilient, secure, and performant new infrastructure,
with the ability to onboard, authenticate, and support users on a massive
scale. It will necessitate an architecture simple enough to support modular
design and rigorous security analysis, but flexible enough to accommodate
current and future functional requirements and use cases. A CBDC will also in
some way need to address an innate tension between privacy and transparency,
protecting user data from abuse while selectively permitting data mining for
end-user services, policymakers, and law enforcement investigations and
interventions.

<p> In this paper, we enumerate the fundamental technical design challenges
facing CBDC designers, with a particular focus on performance, privacy, and
security. Through a survey of relevant academic and industry research and
deployed systems, we discuss the state of the art in technologies that can
address the challenges involved in successful CBDC deployment. We also present
a vision of the rich range of functionalities and use cases that a
well-designed CBDC platform could ultimately offer users.
