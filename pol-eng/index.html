<h1>Political Engineering</h1>
</center>

<p>
This site is a work-in-progress.
It is intended to be a reference to on-line resources
related to the topic of political engineering,
which is the still rather immature discipline
of designing political institutions
deliberately to embody certain values
and achieve certain desired kinds of systemic behavior
while minimizing the risk of subversion or other undesirable behaviors.
I will be filling it out over time;
please feel free to send links and suggestions
to me at "baford" (at) "mit" (dot) "edu".
