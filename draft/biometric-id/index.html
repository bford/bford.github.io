  <h1>Are Biometrics a Good Test for Real Unique Personhood?</h1>
  

<p>Are biometrics good for determining whether a digital identity
<em>uniquely</em> represents a <em>real</em> person?</p>

<p>Break this down:
- Does it represent [the characteristics of] a person?
- Does it uniquely represent a person: i.e., the <em>only</em> identity of that person?
- Does it uniquely represent a real living person?</p>

<h1 id="authentication-identification-and-real-personhood">Authentication, Identification, and Real Personhood</h1>

<p>Biometric authentication is practical, and not necessarily a privacy disaster.
Biometric template only needs to be stored on the device, &hellip;</p>

<p>But biometric identity also needs a uniqueness test.</p>

<p>Priorities: Don&rsquo;t Feed the Surveillance Capitalists</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entities&rdquo;</p>

<p>the cold inhumanness of typical Silicon Valley thinking.
People are mere entities with no special place in the world,
just like companies, gadgets, or bots.
People are just objects to be abstracted, derived,
polymorphically referenced, and iterated over.
From the Silicon Valley perspective,
all the software you build is more powerful and general, and hence better,
if it doesn&rsquo;t know or care whether the objects it manipulates
are people, bots, or anything else.
But I&rsquo;ll let you in on a secret: <em>real people</em> do care.</p>

<p>Call us speceist or something, but I&rsquo;m with Tim Cook&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>    XXX
</code></pre>

<p>And the first and most critical step in ensuring that
technology serves humanity
is to ensure that the technology we build
can <em>distinguish</em> humanity from inhumanity.</p>

<h2 id="key-goals-in-biometric-identity">Key Goals in Biometric Identity</h2>

<p>Relevant security properties:
* Accessibility: Each registered person can successfully access access his/her account (authentication)
* Exclusiveness: No one but the registered person can authenticate as the registered person
* Uniqueness: each real person can register <em>only one</em> account.</p>

<p>The first two should be obvious, but what about the third?</p>

<p>A key goal in most identity schemes is to ensure that no person
can register multiple &ldquo;Sybil&rdquo; identities,
e.g., to vote multiple times in an election,
or to collect state-supplied benefits multiple times.
Collecting two or three or more times the amount of benefits
you&rsquo;re entitled to is appealing to fraudsters
pretty much regardless of what kind of benefits we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

<p>But can biometric identity systems enforce identity uniqueness?
<em>Do</em> currently-deployed biometric identity schemes test for uniqueness?</p>

<p>There are many proposed and a few implemented approaches to biometric identity
and I won&rsquo;t pretend to be familiar with them all,
but let&rsquo;s look at one example:
India&rsquo;s Aadhaar system [xxx].
I choose this example not because I have any reason to believe it to be
better or worse than any other proposed approach I&rsquo;m aware of,
but merely because of its large-scale deployment,
having already been used to register more than 1.1 billion people [xxx].</p>

<p>Privacy challenges:
* It should be hard to steal a biometric template usable for impersonation
* It should be hard to use biometrics for illicit tracking/surveillance</p>

<p>XXX Recently, several researchers have addressed the problem of generating differ- ent synthetic biometric traits such as iris [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], fingerprints [16], signature [17, 18], face [19], handwriting [20], and voice [21].</p>

<p>&ldquo;practical template protection schemes neither have proven
non-invertibility/non-linkability guarantees nor do they achieve satisfactory
recognition per- formance. This explains why despite 20 years of research,
operational biometric systems do not go beyond encrypting the template using
standard encryption techniques and/or storing them in secure hardware.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The main limitation of state-of-the-art template protection techniques is the
trade-off between recognition performance and the level of security offered by
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7420576">Protection of Privacy in Biometric Data</a></p>

<p>Template protection approaches assume an attacker compromises
only a database containing already-protected template information.
But if the attacker compromises <em>any one device</em> that a victim ever uses,
even just once, to authenticate,
then the attacker can capture the ``raw&rdquo; template
before any template protection is applied.
The single compromised device problem again.</p>
