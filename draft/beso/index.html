  <h1>Binary Encoded Schematic Objects (BESO)</h1>
  <p>(or JBIN? or&hellip;?)</p>
<p>BESO provides a generic representation for any JSON,
using JSON Schema information to provide a compact binary encoding.
Unlike schema-free binary encodings like BSON and CBOR,
BESO encoding leverages the schema to optimize the encoded representation,
for example by replacing object tags specified in the schema
with small integers,
by representing numbers in binary integer or floating-point forms, etc.</p>
<p>BESO Generic does not modify the JSON Schema language at all.
It takes only the information already specified in a JSON schema
and provides a more compact schema-optimized binary representation.</p>
<p>The BESO Generic encoding ensures that <em>all</em> valid JSON structures
can still be represented,
including those that extend or fail to conform to the schema.
For example, if a JSON object contains elements not defined in the schema,
then those elements can still be converted to and from BESO encoding
but will just not benefit from the schema&rsquo;s ability to compress known keys.
If a JSON object has values entirely non-conformant with the schema,
such as a value of the wrong type, out of the specified numeric range, etc.,
then that value can still be represented if necessary
and converted correctly between text-based JSON and binary BESO encodings,
although the value will fail a schema compliance check of course.</p>
<p>This concise list of goals distinguishes BESO</p>
<ul>
<li>Any valid JSON convertible to BESO and vice versa with no loss of information</li>
<li>Compact binary representation balanced against encoding/decoding simplicity</li>
<li>Encoding without a schema (or with a null schema <code>{}</code>) fully self-describing</li>
<li>Encoding with a schema can achieves additional compactness,
by representing schema-defined names into small integers</li>
<li>Schematic BESO encoding should make JSON-based protocols
like <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification">JSON-RPC</a>
competitive with binary-centric protocol formats
like <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protobuf</a>
and <a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC</a>.</li>
<li>Preserve the extensibility of JSON:
e.g., new properties can be added to object schema
without breaking backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>Compatible with both limited-precision uses
(e.g., where all numbers are limited to 64-bit floating as in JavaScript)
and high-precision uses
(e.g., arbitrary-precision integers, floats, rationals).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="untyped-schema">Untyped schema</h2>
<p>When the schema specifies neither a <code>type</code> nor <code>enum</code> constraint,
and hence allows any JSON value type,
the binary encoding of each of the JSON value types is as described here.
The first byte of the binary encoding determines
the JSON value type it encodes,
as summarized in the following list and detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x00-0x17: a zigzag-encoded signed integer</li>
<li>0x18: a floating-point number with a base-2 exponent</li>
<li>0x19: a floating-point number with a base-10 exponent</li>
<li>0x1a: an array of values</li>
<li>0x1b: a map of key/value pairs (an object)</li>
<li>0x1c: a boolean false value</li>
<li>0x1d: a boolean true value</li>
<li>0x1e: a null value</li>
<li>0x1f: a string containing base64-encoded binary data</li>
<li>0x20-0xff: a string in UTF-8 encoding</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integer-values">Integer values</h3>
<p>A JSON number whose value is a signed integer
is first zigzag-encoded into an unsigned integer
with the least-significant bit serving as the sign flag.
A non-negative value <em>v</em> becomes 2<em>v</em>,
while a negative value <em>v</em> becomes -2<em>v</em>+1.
The resulting unsigned integer is then serialized
into a variable number of bytes in network (big-endian) byte order.
Finally, if the first (most-significant) byte of the encoding
is not in the range 0x00 through 0x0f,
then a leading zero byte is prepended.</p>
<p>Some example encodings of integers are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>	+0   -&gt; [0x00]
	-0   -&gt; [0x01]
	+1   -&gt; [0x02]
	-1   -&gt; [0x03]
	+2   -&gt; [0x04]
	-2   -&gt; [0x05]
	+7   -&gt; [0x0e]
	-7   -&gt; [0x0f]
	+8   -&gt; [0x00,0x10]
	-8   -&gt; [0x00,0x11]
	+128 -&gt; [0x01,0x00]
	-128 -&gt; [0x01,0x01]
	+256 -&gt; [0x02,0x00]
	-256 -&gt; [0x02,0x01]
</code></pre>
<p>In this way, integers close to zero remain small after zigzag-encoding,
and thus require few bytes to serialize.
Integers of up to four bits including sign require one byte,
integers up to twelve bits including sign require two bytes, etc.</p>
<p>Notice that unlike the zigzag encoding
<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#signed-integers">used in protobufs</a>,
this encoding has representations for positive and negative zero.
While negative zero is not representable in most native integer formats,
the integer encoding is also usable to encode floating-point numbers
that have no fractional component,
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE floating-point formats</a>
do have both positive and negative zero.
Thus, writers are typically expected to produce -0
only when serializing a floating-point number as an integer,
with readers treating +0 and -0 as identical when converting
to standard internal integer formats.</p>
<p>For compactness writers should generally avoid encoding
unnecessary leading zero bytes in the serialized representation,
but readers must be prepared to accept them.
Writers may sometimes have reason to produce
non-essential leading zero bytes:
for example, to pad numbers representing cryptographic secrets
to a constant time to minimize the risk of side-channel leaks.</p>
<h3 id="floating-point-numbers">Floating-point numbers</h3>
<p>Non-integral JSON numbers are encoded into binary floating-point representation
using either base-2 (binary) or base-10 (decimal) fractions.
The first byte of the value encoding
is 0x10 for floating-point with a binary fraction,
and 0x11 for floating-point with a decimal fraction.</p>
<p>Encoders converting from decimal string representation (e.g., JSON text)
should generally encode the number using a base-10 fraction
in order to avoid losing precision in the conversion.
Encoders converting from internal binary floating-point representations,
however,
can use base-2 fractions to encode numbers more space-efficiently
without loss of precision.</p>
<p>The binary encoding of the floating-point number
consists of the 0x10 (binary fraction) or 0x11 (decimal fraction) prefix,
followed by a CBE-encoded exponent,
and finally a mantissa comprising the rest of the encoded byte sequence.</p>
<p>The exponent consists of a variable-length signed integer,
which is first zigzag-encoded into a binary unsigned integer,
then serialized into a big-endian byte string,
and finally CBE-encoded to delimit its length.</p>
<p>In the exponent&rsquo;s zigzag encoding,
the encoded value 1 is special
and indicates infinity or not-a-number (NaN) values,
rather than a negative zero exponent.</p>
<p>Some example exponents are as follows
after both zigzag-encoding and CBE-encoding:</p>
<pre><code>	e = 0        -&gt; [0x00]            1-byte CBE-encoding for
	infinity/NaN -&gt; [0x01]            1-byte exponent 0x00-0x7f
	e = +1       -&gt; [0x02]
	e = -1       -&gt; [0x03]
	e = +2       -&gt; [0x04]
	e = -2       -&gt; [0x05]
	e = +63      -&gt; [0x7e]
	e = -63      -&gt; [0x7f]
	e = +64      -&gt; [0x81,0x80]       2-byte CBE-encoding for
	e = -64      -&gt; [0x81,0x81]       1-byte exponent 0x80-0xff
	e = +127     -&gt; [0x81,0xfe]
	e = -127     -&gt; [0x81,0xff]
	e = +128     -&gt; [0x82,0x01,0x00]  3-byte CBE-encoding for
	e = -128     -&gt; [0x82,0x01,0x01]  2-byte exponents
	e = +32767   -&gt; [0x82,0xff,0xfe]
	e = -32767   -&gt; [0x82,0xff,0xff]
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the mantissa uses the same zigzag encoding as for integers,
with encoded values 0 and 1 representing positive and negative zero.
The mantissa is then serialized in network (big-endian) byte order
<em>without</em> CBE-encoding,
which is unnecessary as the mantissa always accounts for the remainder
of the encoded floating-point number.</p>
<p>When representing zeros and infinities,
the mantissa field can be empty, i.e., zero bytes long.
This is the preferred representation since it is the most compact.</p>
<p>Some example mantissa encodings are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>	m = +0     -&gt; []
	m = -0     -&gt; [0x01]
	m = +1     -&gt; [0x02]
	m = -1     -&gt; [0x03]
	m = +2     -&gt; [0x04]
	m = -2     -&gt; [0x05]
	m = +127   -&gt; [0xfe]
	m = -127   -&gt; [0xff]
	m = +128   -&gt; [0x01,0x00]
	m = -128   -&gt; [0x01,0x01]
	m = +32767 -&gt; [0xff,0xfe]
	m = -32767 -&gt; [0xff,0xff]
</code></pre>
<p>Readers must be prepared to accept leading zero bytes
in the exponent and/or mantissa.
Writers should normally avoid producing leading zero bytes
when compactness is desired,
but may produce leading zeros in order to ensure that encoded values
are some fixed (but explicitly-encoded) length.</p>
<p>For NaNs, consistent with IEEE 754,
the most-significant bit of the (first byte of the) mantissa
indicates whether the NaN is a quiet or signaling NaN.
Since the variable-length floating-point mantissa
can be any number of bytes long,
this means that the quiet or signaling NaN flag
can be mantissa bit 7, 15, 23, etc.</p>
<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>A binary-encoded JSON array consists of
the prefix byte 0x12 followed by a sequence of
any number of items.
Each item is first binary encoded
using the untyped schema encoding defined in this section,
then CBE-encoded to delimit its length,
and finally all the CBE-encoded items are concatenated.</p>
<h3 id="keyvalue-maps-or-objects">Key/value maps or objects</h3>
<p>A binary-encoded JSON object consists of
the prefix byte 0x13 followed by a sequence of
any number of key/value pairs.
The keys and values are each first binary encoded
using the untyped schema encoding defined in this section,
then CBE-encoded to delimit their lengths,
and finally all the key/value pairs are concatenated.</p>
<h3 id="boolean-values">Boolean values</h3>
<p>A boolean value is represented by either
the single byte 0x14, denoting <code>true</code>,
or the single byte 0x15, denoting <code>false</code>.
Writers should ensure that the encoding is only one byte,
and readers should ignore any bytes beyond the first.</p>
<h3 id="null-values">Null values</h3>
<p>A <code>null</code> value is represented by the single byte 0x16.
Writers should ensure that the encoding is only one byte,
and readers should ignore any bytes beyond the first.</p>
<h3 id="string-values">String values</h3>
<p>The normal binary encoding of a JSON string value
is simply the UTF-8 encoding of the string,
provided that the string is nonempty and its first character
is not an ASCII control character,
namely 0x00-0x1f or 0x7f.</p>
<p>In this way, the binary encodings of most strings incur no space overhead.
Further, because the CBE encoding of a string consisting
of only one ASCII character remains only one byte long after encoding,
the common space-saving practice of using single-character property names
in JSON data translates to single-byte CBE-encoded property keys
in the binary representation of objects as well.</p>
<p>If the JSON string to be encoded is empty
or its first character is a control character,
then its BESO untyped encoding is a single byte 0x7f (ASCII DEL)
followed by the string&rsquo;s UTF-8 encoding.
While writers generally should only prepend the 0x7f prefix
only to strings that start with control characters,
readers should be prepared to accept any UTF-8 string escaped this way.</p>
<h4 id="strings-containing-base64-encoded-binary-data">Strings containing base64-encoded binary data</h4>
<p>It is common practice to embed binary data in JSON strings
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> encoding.
To reduce the space overhead incurred by base64 encoding,
JSON string values that strictly conform to the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648">base64 specification</a>
can be encoded in a compact binary form,
consisting of a single 0x1f byte
followed by the raw <em>decoded</em> binary content of the base64-encoded string.</p>
<h2 id="enumerated-schema">Enumerated schema</h2>
<p>When a JSON schema specifies an <code>enum</code> constraint,
regardless of the presence or absence of a <code>type</code> constraint,
the corresponding binary encoding uses compact unsigned integers
to represent indices in the list of allowed values.</p>
<p>When the value to be encoded is one of those listed in the <code>enum</code> constraint,
the binary encoding is its zero-based position in the <code>enum</code> list,
serialized to a variable-length byte string in network byte order.
If the first byte of this serialization is 0xff,
then a leading zero byte is prepended.</p>
<p>The preferred encoding of the first value in the <code>enum</code> list
is the empty byte string.
Since a schema with a
<a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/generic.html#constant-values"><code>const</code> property</a>
is synonymous with a single-value <code>enum</code>,
this implies that a constant schema may be encoded as the empty string.</p>
<p>If the value to be encoded is not one of those allowed by the <code>enum</code>,
i.e., a value non-conformant to the schema,
then the binary encoding is a single 0xff byte
followed by the untyped encoding of the value.</p>
<p>Consider this schema, for example:</p>
<pre><code>	{
	  &quot;enum&quot;: [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;amber&quot;, &quot;green&quot;]
	}
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustrates how four example values are encoded:</p>
<pre><code>	&quot;red&quot;   -&gt; []
	&quot;amber&quot; -&gt; [0x01]
	&quot;green&quot; -&gt; [0x02]
	&quot;blue&quot;  -&gt; [0xff,0x62,0x6c,0x75,0x65]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="schema-of-integer-type">Schema of integer type</h2>
<p>When the scheme specifies a <code>type</code> of <code>integer</code>,
the binary representation is specialized for maximum space-efficiency
in representing binary integers,
while still allowing values non-conformant to the schema to be represented.</p>
<p>An integer value is first zigzag-encoded
and serialized into a variable-length big-endian byte string,
in exactly the same way as for integers encoded with untyped schema.
Then, only if the serialized integer&rsquo;s first byte is 0xff,
a leading zero byte is prepended.</p>
<p>A non-integer value not conforming to the schema
is first encoded as for untyped schema,
then a single 0xff byte is prepended to that encoding.</p>
<p>An integer with value +0 may be encoded as the empty string,
and this is the preferred encoding.</p>
<p>With this encoding, integers between -126 and +127
require at most one byte to represent,
integers between -32639 and +32639 require at most two bytes,
and so on,
as the following encoding examples illustrate:</p>
<pre><code>	+0      -&gt; []
	-0      -&gt; [0x01]
	+1      -&gt; [0x02]
	-1      -&gt; [0x03]
	+126    -&gt; [0xfc]
	-126    -&gt; [0xfd]
	+127    -&gt; [0xfe]
	-127    -&gt; [0x00,0xff]
	+128    -&gt; [0x01,0x00]
	-128    -&gt; [0x01,0x01]
	+32639  -&gt; [0xfe,0xfe]
	-32639  -&gt; [0xfe,0xff]
	+32640  -&gt; [0x00,0xff,0x00]
	-32640  -&gt; [0x00,0xff,0x01]
	+32767  -&gt; [0x00,0xff,0xfe]
	-32767  -&gt; [0x00,0xff,0xff]
	+32768  -&gt; [0x01,0x00,0x00]
	-32768  -&gt; [0x01,0x00,0x01]
	null    -&gt; [0xff,0x1e]
	&quot;a&quot;     -&gt; [0xff,0x61]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="schema-of-number-type">Schema of number type</h2>

<p>alternately:</p>

<p>alternatively:</p>
<p>just keep it simple and use the untyped schema representation?</p>
<h2 id="schema-of-array-type">Schema of array type</h2>
<p>To encode a JSON array value with a schema of type <code>array</code>,
the array&rsquo;s individual elements are first binary encoded
using the appropriate sub-schema for the array&rsquo;s individual items,
as specified in <code>items</code> and <code>additionalItems</code> properties if present.
These binary-encoded items are then individually CBE-encoded
then concatenated in order.
Finally, if the first byte of the resulting array encoding
is either 0xfe or 0xff,
then a single 0xfe byte is prepended.</p>
<p>To encode a JSON value other than an array,
the value is first encoded using the untyped encoding,
then a single 0xff byte is prepended.</p>
<h2 id="schema-of-object-type">Schema of object type</h2>
<p>To encode a JSON object with a schema of type <code>object</code>,
the properties in the object to be encoded are first classified
into three categories: <em>required</em>, <em>known</em>, and <em>unknown</em>.
Required properties are those listed in the schema&rsquo;s <code>required</code> clause, if any.
Known properties are those listed in the object schema&rsquo;s <code>properties</code> clause.
Unknown properties are any appearing in neither clause.</p>
<p>The binary encoding of such a JSON object consists of
an optional 0xfe prefix byte,
followed by an array encoding of the object&rsquo;s required properties,
and finally by a sequence of key/value pairs representing
the known and unknown optional properties.
Once the object&rsquo;s properties have been serialized,
if the first byte of their encoding is either 0xfe or 0xff,
then a single 0xfe byte is prepended.</p>
<p>To encode a JSON object conforming to the schema,
each of the object&rsquo;s required properties
is first encoded using the schema specified for that property, if any.
Each required property is then individually CBE-encoded in order,
just as for arrays.
The number of CBE-encoded blobs in this sequence
must exactly match the number of properties the schema lists as `required&rsquo;.
If any required properties
are not actually present in the object to be encoded
(implying that the object is non-conformant with the schema),
then the object must be encoded as for an untyped schema
with a 0xff prefix byte prepended as specified below.</p>
<p>Following the encodings of the required properties
is a variable-length sequence of key/value pairs
representing the known and unknown optional properties,
in arbitrary order.</p>
<p>For known properties,
the key is encoded as an unsigned integer index
into the schema&rsquo;s <code>properties</code> clause.
Zero represents the first property the schema lists in its <code>properties</code> object,
one represents the second property listed, and so on.
This implies that while for schema <em>validation</em>
the order in which properties are listed is not important,
for JSBE encoding using a schema the order of properties <em>is</em> important:
reordering the properties list will change the schema&rsquo;s binary encoding.
The unsigned integer key is then serialized into a big-endian byte string.
If the first byte of the resulting string
is not in the range 0x00 through 1e,
then a leading zero byte is prepended.
Finally, the serialized key is CBE-encoded.</p>
<p>For unknown properties,
the property name string is first encoded as for untyped schema,
resulting in either a regular string or base64 string encoding
whose first byte is in the range 0x1f through 0xff.
This encoded property name string is then CBE-encoded.</p>
<p>The value of a known property is first binary encoded
using the appropriate schema for that property,
then this binary encoding is CBE-encoded.
The value of an unknown property is binary encoded
as for untyped schema,
then CBE-encoded.</p>
<p>For non-conformant JSON values that are not objects
or that do not have all the properties the schema lists as <code>required</code>,
the entire object is first encoded as for untyped schema,
then a single 0xff byte is prepended to the encoding.</p>
<p>XXX some examples</p>
<h2 id="schema-of-other-types">Schema of other types</h2>
<p>For schema of type <code>boolean</code>, <code>null</code>, or <code>string</code>,
the binary encoding is identical to that of untyped schema.
That is, the encodings of these types of values
are not specialized and do not receive
any space-efficiency benefit from having a schema.
This is mainly because the untyped encodings of these JSON value types
are already extremely space-efficient,
and the complexity cost of specialization for these types
would probably not be worth the small opportunity for further space saving.</p>

<h3 id="fixed-length-unsigned-integers">Fixed-length unsigned integers</h3>
<p>An <code>encoding</code> of <code>unsigned</code> indicates that an integer
is to be encoded in unsigned binary representation
a given number of bits wide.
For example, this type indicates an integer
encoded in exactly one byte as an unsigned integer:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;unsigned&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 8
}
</code></pre>
<p>The `bits&rsquo; property&rsquo;s value must be a nonnegative integer
indicating the bit-width of this representation.</p>
<p>If <code>bits</code> is greater than 8,
then the <code>encoding</code> property must also have a <code>byteOrder</code> property
specifying the endianness of the representation:
either <code>bigEndian</code> (network byte order) or <code>littleEndian</code>.</p>
<p>XXX or should <code>encoding</code> default to network byte order (<code>bigEndian</code>)?
Perhaps it should for purposes of defining new formats,
but a strict-specification mode for schema validators
should require endianness to be specified?</p>
<p>An example of a 32-bit unsigned integer encoding in network byte-order:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;unsigned&quot;,
	&quot;byteOrder&quot;: &quot;bigEndian&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 32
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>bits</code> field need not be a power of two.
For example, this integer is encoded in three bytes:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;unsigned&quot;,
	&quot;byteOrder&quot;: &quot;littleEndian&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 24
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the above examples did not specify a semantic value range
via <code>minimum</code> or <code>maximum</code>,
although the specified encoding can represent only a certain range of values.
This is not necessarily an error:
it simply means that not all <em>semantically</em> permitted values
are representable in the specified binary representation.
This corresponds to the arguably lazy but common practice in designing
software, programming languages, and binary formats to postulate
that some number of bits &ldquo;should be enough&rdquo; for all expected values
even though a specific value range has not been clearly defined.
Semantically allowing unrepresentable values may arguably be considered
bad practice for designing new formats and schemas, however,
so schema validators may want to provide a configuration option
that yields warnings or errors when a fixed-length representation is specified
without a specified <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> that is representable.</p>
<p>The following variant of the above 24-bit integer example
restricts the semantic value to a range of 1 through 16,000,000,
a subset of the representable value range of 0 through 16,777,215 (2^24-1).</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;minimum&quot;: 1,
	&quot;maximum&quot;: 16000000
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;unsigned&quot;,
	&quot;byteOrder&quot;: &quot;littleEndian&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 24
}
</code></pre>
<p>For now, <code>bits</code> must be a multiple of 8.
We might later want to relax this to support
packed bit fields and bit streams.
But then we will probably also need to define a <code>bitOrder</code> property
specifying the bit order within bytes
(i.e., whether we start filling bytes
from the most-significant or the least-significant bit).</p>
<h3 id="fixed-length-signed-integers">Fixed-length signed integers</h3>
<p>An <code>encoding</code> property of <code>unsigned</code> indicates
that an integer is to be encoded as a fixed-width integer
in standard binary two&rsquo;s-complement encoding,
with the most-significant bit serving as the sign bit.
As with unsigned integers,
a <code>bits</code> property is required and must be a multiple of 8 for now,
and a <code>byteOrder</code> property is required if <code>bits</code> is greater than 8.</p>
<p>An example of an 8-bit signed integer:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;signed&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 8
}
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, a 64-bit little-endian signed integer:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;signed&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 64,
	&quot;byteOrder&quot;: &quot;littleEndian&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="offset-encoded-integers">Offset-encoded integers</h3>
<p>Integers may have an <code>offset</code> property to indicate
that the semantic value is the offset plus the encoded value.
For example, this schema type represents semantic values
between 200 through 300 inclusive,
encoded as single-byte values from 0 through 100:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;minimum&quot;: 200,
	&quot;maximum&quot;: 300,
	&quot;offset&quot;: 200,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;unsigned/bigEndian&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 8
}
</code></pre>
<p>When an <code>offset</code> is specified and is less than or equal to the <code>minimum</code>,
an unsigned-integer representation may be used
even if <code>minimum</code> is less than or equal to zero.
This example encodes values from -100 through 100 in one byte,
with byte value 0 representing semantic value -100,
100 representing 0,
and 200 representing 100:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
	&quot;minimum&quot;: -100,
	&quot;maximum&quot;: 100,
	&quot;offset&quot;: -100,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;unsigned&quot;,
	&quot;bits&quot;: 8
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="floating-point-numbers-1">Floating-point numbers</h2>
<h3 id="fixed-length-binary-floating-point-numbers">Fixed-length binary floating-point numbers</h3>
<p>When the scheme type is <code>number</code>,
an associated `encoding&rsquo; property may name one of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a>
standard fixed-length floating-point number representations
to indicate that representation be used
as the binary encoding of this number.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot;,
	&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;binary32&quot;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The floating-point representations currently defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008_revision">IEEE 754-2008</a>
are <code>binary16</code>, <code>binary32</code>, <code>binary64</code>, and <code>binary128</code>
for binary floating-point representations,
and <code>decimal32</code>, <code>decimal64</code>, and <code>decimal128</code>
for decimal floating-point representations.
More standard floating-point encodings may be defined in the future,
of course.</p>

<h2 id="variable-length-strings">Variable-length strings</h2>
<h2 id="packed-arrays-with-fixed-length-items">Packed arrays with fixed-length items</h2>
<p>A schema of type <code>array</code> may specify an <code>encoding</code> of <code>packed</code>
to indicate a packed array of fixed-length elements.
This example expresses a packed array of 8-bit unsigned integers:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;array&quot;,
	&quot;items&quot;: {
		&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;,
		&quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;unsigned&quot;,
		&quot;bits&quot;: 8
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The array element schema specified in the <code>items</code> property
<em>must</em> have a fixed-length binary representation for packed array encoding.</p>
<p>If the array also has a fixed length,
i.e., <code>minItems</code> and <code>maxItems</code> values both specified and equal,
then the resulting packed array has a fixed-length binary representation,
which is exactly the element type length times the array length.</p>
<h2 id="cbe-encoded-arrays-with-variable-length-items">CBE-encoded arrays with variable-length items</h2>
<p>A schema of type <code>array</code> with an <code>encoding</code> of <code>cbe</code>
indicates that the array has a binary representation consisting of
a sequence of variable-length items, each individually CBE-encoded.</p>
