  <h1>Composable Text Syntax</h1>
  <p>XXX to be written.</p>
<p>goal: composability.
A valid CTs text inserted into another should remain a valid CTS text.</p>
<p>Matched open/close punctuation pairs, which we call matchers.</p>
<p>Basic principle: matchers must match.
This dominates all other more specialized syntaxes.</p>
<p>We could define a variant of CTS for any particular set of matchers we want;
all the principles would be the same.</p>
<p>But to avoid further confusion,
would be best to have one &ldquo;standardized&rdquo; set of matchers.  But which?
Especially since Unicode provides seventy-some matched pairs,
some of them typically used in different combinations.</p>
<p>But since the ASCII subset of the Unicode character set
is the one still typically used in mechanically-parsed languages,
we choose as our matchers the ASCII characters formally defined
as open/close punctuation characters:
namely the square brackets &ldquo;[]&rdquo;, parentheses &ldquo;()&rdquo;, and curly braces &ldquo;{}&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why not the so-called &ldquo;angle brackets&rdquo;?
Because these ASCII characters are formally defined
as less-than and greater-than signs,
and ubiquitously used in non-matching form as such
in arithmetic expressions and the like.
Because of this ambiguous overloading of less-than and greater-than signs,
their use as angle brackets is problematic in numerous ways,
leading to their sometimes being called
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/broket">brokets</a>.
Unicode defined a separate set of angle brackets ⟨⟩
especially as open/close punctuation.</p>
<p>Few existing text languages just happen to be &ldquo;CTS compliant&rdquo; already,
but many of them are extremely <em>close</em> to CTS-compliant.
Programming languages typically use the ASCII open/close punctuation
in matching pairs anyway whenever they are syntactically relevant.</p>
