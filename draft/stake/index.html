  <h1>Secure, Scalable Proof-of-Stake Blockchains</h1>
  <h1 id="proof-of-what">Proof-of-What?</h1>
<p>Currently-deployed permissionless blockchains
such as Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">proof-of-work (PoW)</a>
to distribute both the computational networking costs,
and the financial rewards,
of maintaining and extending the blockchain.
In proof-of-work systems, participating <em>miners</em>
race (&ldquo;work&rdquo;) to compute solutions to cryptographic puzzles.
These puzzles effectively act like self-printed lottery tickets,
in that a miniscule fraction of these proof-of-work solutions
may be easily verified by anyone as &ldquo;winning&rdquo; the lucky miner
the right to add one block to the blockchain and collect associated rewards.
Proof-of-work has proven practical and relatively secure,
at least for cryptocurrencies with sufficient critical mass to deter
<a href="https://cryptohustle.com/51-attack-crew-extorts-and-hijacks-blockchains-for-ransom">ransom or hijacking by powerful attackers</a>.
However, it has been
<a href="https://pando.com/2013/12/16/bitcoin-has-a-dark-side-its-carbon-footprint/">recognized for years</a>
that proof-of-work blockchains are
<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3zn9a/ethereum-mining-transaction-electricity-consumption-bitcoin">a tremendous waste of energy</a>.
Recent estimates show that
<a href="http://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">Bitcoin now consumes more energy than 60% of the world&rsquo;s countries</a>,
and that
<a href="http://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption">Ethereum already consumes more energy
than Cyprus or Cambodia</a>.</p>
<p>Motivated in part by this energy waste and its carbon footprint,
the cryptocurrency community has developed increasing interest
in alternative security foundations such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake">proof-of-stake (PoS)</a>.
The essence of this idea is to apportion consensus power
not according to energy wasted performing useless work,
but rather according to the amount of &ldquo;stake&rdquo;
that participants already hold in the system:
e.g., according to the number of coins they own.
The underlying principle is not unlike that of a traditional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company">joint-stock company</a>,
in which voting power to affect a company&rsquo;s decisions
(e.g., by electing board members who in turn choose executives)
is apportioned in proportion to shares of stock (&ldquo;stake&rdquo;)
held in the company.
The venerable underlying security principle is that stakeholders
have an interest in preserving and ideally increasing
the value of their stake &ndash;
with bigger stakeholders having more to gain (or lose)
from good (or bad) decisions &ndash;
thereby aligning their individual interests with those of the overall system.
While proof-of-stake conceptually represents
a sensible and promising alternative to proof-of-work,
<em>implementing</em> proof-of-stake systems securely
<a href="https://blog.sldx.com/whats-wrong-with-proof-of-stake-77d4f370be15">is challenging</a>,
due to many difficulties well-documented in
<a href="http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/pos-vs-pow-1.0.2.pdf">a BitFury white paper</a>
and elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="is-proof-of-investment-really-the-answer">Is Proof-of-Investment Really the Answer?</h1>
<p>Proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are both
<em>investment-proportional</em> security foundations,
in that they apportion consensus power and mining rewards
proportionally to prior investment
(in computational effort or coin purchases, respectively).
Many other alternatives such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-space">proof of space</a>,
<a href="https://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/hotpets14-torpath-abs">proof of bandwidth</a>,
and
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/145.pdf">proof of human work</a>
similarly fit into the same broad category,
which might be accurately classified as <em>proof of investment</em>.
In the long term,
I am skeptical that cryptocurrencies based on proof of investment
will fundamentally transform our society or economy for the better
(or at all really).
At the end of the day,
cryptocurrencies or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">decentralized autonomous organizations</a>
based on proof of investment are merely a more-automated
functional equivalent to the stakeholder-driven joint-stock companies
that already dominate today&rsquo;s global economy,
and hence are fundamentally nothing new.</p>
<p>In other words, proof-of-investment cryptocurrencies
may put more white-collar office workers out of work and hasten the
<a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/04/rise-machines-future-lots-robots-jobs-humans/">rise of the machines</a>,
but will ultimately do little to address society&rsquo;s fundamental challenges
such as
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/inequality-world-economy-wef-brexit-donald-trump-world-economic-forum-risk-report">rising economic inequality</a>.
For that purpose, I see more promise in truly democratic alternatives
such as
<a href="https://zerobyte.io/publications/2017-BKJGGF-pop.pdf">proof-of-personhood</a>
or
<a href="http://proofofindividuality.online/">proof-of-individuality</a>,
which could create a sort of
&ldquo;permissionless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">basic income</a>&rdquo;
by apportioning voting and consensus power and currency-mining rewards
to all <em>human</em> participants, in a one-person-one-vote distribution.
But truly democratizing and decentralizing cryptocurrencies
will require solving many further challenges.
In the meantime, even if proof-of-stake achieves nothing but
ending the energy waste and environmental impact of proof-of-work,
that goal is easily worth pursuing.
And it&rsquo;s an interesting technical challenge,
so the rest of this blog post will focus on that.</p>
