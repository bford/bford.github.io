Could you use a markup syntax
that supports the full expressive power and richness of HTML or XML,
but is more terse, easier to type, and less frankly ugly?
To <em>emphasize</em> text, for example,
would it be nice just to write <code>em[emphasize]</code>
instead of <code>&lt;em&gt;emphasize&lt;/em&gt;</code>?
If so, pleae read on.


<h2>The tussle between generality and writer-friendliness</h2>

Markup languages derived from SGML, like HTML and XML,
have many uses but are verbose and often a pain to write or edit manually.
While XML was substantially a reaction to the complexity and bloat of SGML,
terseness was always considered of
<a href="https://www.schematron.com/document/467.html">minimal importance</a>
in XML.

<p></p>
Reactions to the verbosity and awkwardness of SGML, HTML, and XML
brought us formats like
<a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>
and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.
But while JSON is useful for automated data interchange,
it is not a markup language.
Its strict and minimal syntax demanded further extensions like
<a href="https://yaml.org">YAML</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>, or
<a href="https://json5.org">JSON5</a>
even to get, say, a way to write comments.

<p></p>
Markdown <em>is</em> a markup language,
which vastly improves terseness and quick typeability
for the most common and simple markup constructs.
But its expressiveness is limited to a small subset of HTML.
Further,
the quirky special-case syntax it uses for each construct
makes its syntax difficult to “scale” to richer functionality
without getting into a mess of syntax conflicts and ambiguities.
It is not easy to standardize, or even to specify rigorously –
not to say this 
<a href="https://commonmark.org">hasn't been tried</a>.

<p></p>
There are numerous extensions and alternative variants of Markdown-style syntax
to choose from, of course: e.g.,
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub flavor</a>,
<a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html"><i>re</i>Structured<i>Text</i></a>,
<a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod">POD</a>,
<a href="https://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a>,
<a href="https://asciidoc.org">AsciiDoc</a>,
<a href="https://www.promptworks.com/textile">Textile</a>,
<a href="https://leanpub.com/markua/read">Markua</a>,
<a href="https://txt2tags.org">txt2tags</a>,
etc.
Each of these variants supports a <i>different</i> small subset of HTML,
each with its own syntactic quirks for the markup author to learn afresh.
Further, each flavor's limitations present expressiveness barrierss:
“oh, but now can I do <i>that</i>?”
These expressiveness barriers
can at any moment lead the frustrated author
to seek escape routes –
back to HTML,
or to another existing Markdown flavor,
or to create <em>yet another</em> new flavor
with ever-more-devilishly clever and brittle syntax
with another new set of limitations.

<p></p>
On <a href="/">my web site</a>,
I used to embed HTML tags in <code>.md</code> files
in order to escape Markdown's limitations.
But when an “upgrade”
to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>
silently corrupted the entire website
by suddenly disabling all markdown-embedded HTML,
I realized the essential fragility of this solution.
Even if markdown-embedded HTML 
<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/hugo-embed-html-markdown/">can be re-enabled</a>,
I do not want all my past writing being silently corrupted on a regular basis
by the latest evolution in the markdown parser or its default configuration.
Markdown and <em>all</em> its flavors are risky dead-ends in the long term.
There <em>is</em> real value in relying on stable, highly-standardized,
general-purpose markup formats like HTML or XML.
But do I <em>really</em> have to keep typing all those stupid start and end tags?


<h2>Introducing MinML</h2>

MinML 
(which I pronounce like “minimal”)
is a more concise or “minified” syntax
for markup languages like HTML and XML.
It is designed to be automatically cross-convertible
both to and from the base markup syntax,
and to preserve the full expressiveness of the underlying markup.
Unlike Markdown, there is nothing you can write in HTML but not in MinML.
MinML might be described as
merely a new “skin” for the base markup language.
It changes <em>only</em> the way you write element tags,
attributes, or character references,
without affecting (or even knowing or caring about)
<em>which</em> element tags, attributes, or references you use.
MinML therefore not only supports the expressive richness of HTML now,
but MinML's expressiveness will keep growing with HTML's
in the future.

<p></p>
Let us start with a brief tour of MinML syntax.


<h3>Basic markup elements</h3>

In place of start/end tag pairs,
MinML uses the basic syntax <code><var>tag</var>[<var>content</var>]</code>,
as illustrated in the following table:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>HTML</th>
		<th>MinML</th>
		<th>Output</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>&lt;em&gt;emphasis&lt;/em&gt;</code></td>
		<td><code>em[emphasis]</code></td>
		<td><em>emphasis</em></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>&lt;kbd&gt;typewriter&lt;/kbd&gt;</code></td>
		<td><code>kbd[typewriter]</code></td>
		<td><kbd>typewriter</kbd></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;</code></td>
		<td><code>var[x]sup[2]</code></td>
		<td><var>x</var><sup>2</sup></td>
	</tr>
</table>

An element with no content,
like <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> in HRML or <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code> in XML,
becomes <code>hr[]</code> in MinML.


<h3>Elements with attributes</h3>

In MinML, we attach attributes to elements
by inserting them in curly braces between the tag
and square-bracketed content, like this:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>MinML</th>
		<th>Output</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>hr{width=100%}[]</code></td>
		<td><hr width="100%"/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>img{src=cat.jpg height=40}[]</code></td>
		<td><img src="cat.jpg" height="40"/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>a{href=http://bford.info/}[my home page]</code></td>
		<td><a href="http://bford.info/">my home page</a></td>
	</tr>
</table>

If an attribute value in an element needs to contain spaces,
we quote the value with square brackets, like this:

<pre>	img{src=cat.jpg alt=[a cute cat photo]}[]
</pre>


<h3>Character references</h3>

MinML uses square brackets
in place of SGML's bizarre <code>&amp;</code>…<code>;</code> syntax
to delimit character references.
Thus,
you write <code>[reg]</code> in MinML
instead of <code>&amp;reg;</code> in HTML
to get a registered trademark sign ®.

<p></p>
You can use numeric character references too,
of course.
For example,
<code>[#174]</code> in decimal or <code>[#x00AE]</code> in hexadecimal
are alternative representations for the character ®.


<h3>Quoted strings</h3>

You can of course use the directed (left and right)
single- and double-quote character references
to typeset quoted strings properly.
Writing <code>[ldquo]quote[rdquo]</code> in MinML,
as opposed to <code>&amp;ldquo;quote&amp;rdquo;</code> in XML,
already seems like a slightly-improved way to express
a quoted “string”.

<p></p>
Because quoted strings are such an important common case, however,
MinML provides an even more concise alternative for matching quotes.
You can write <code>"[string]</code> to express
a “string” delimited by matching double quotes,
or <code>'[string]</code>
for a ‘string’ delimited by matching single quotes.


<h3>Comments in markup</h3>

You can include comments in markup
with <code>-[<var>c</var>]</code>, like this:

<table style="width:75%;padding:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
	<tr>
		<th>HTML</th>
		<th>MinML</th>
		<th>Output</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code></td>
		<td><code>-[comment]</code></td>
		<td><!--comment--></td>
	</tr>
</table>


<h3>Managing whitespace</h3>

Because an element tag is outside (just before)
an open bracket or curly brace in MinML,
we often need whitespace to separate an element from preceding text:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>bee em[yoo] tiful</code></td>
		<td>bee <em>yoo</em> tiful</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Without the whitespace before the <code>em</code> tag,
it would look like the incorrect tag <code>beeem</code>.
If you don't actually want whitespace around an element, however,
you can use less-than <code>&lt;</code> and greater-than <code>&gt;</code> signs
to consume or “suck” the surrounding whitespace:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>bee &lt;em[yoo]&gt; tiful</code></td>
		<td>bee<em>yoo</em>tiful</td>
	</tr>
</table>

These space-sucking symbols are <em>not</em> delimiters as in SGML, however,
and need not appear in matched pairs.
You can use them to suck space on one side but not the other:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>mark &lt;em[up] now</code></td>
		<td>mark<em>up</em> now</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>now em[mark]&gt; up</code></td>
		<td>now <em>mark</em>up</td>
	</tr>
</table>

You can also use space-suckers <em>within</em> an element's content,
to suck space at the beginning and/or end of the content:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>a &lt;b[&gt; b &lt;]&gt; c</code></td>
		<td>a<b>b</b>c</td>
	</tr>
</table>

If you need literal square brackets or curly braces
immediately after what could otherwise be an element name,
you can separate them with whitespace and a space-sucker:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>b[1 &lt;[hellip]&gt; 10]</code></td>
		<td><b>1…10</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>b &lt;[1 &lt;[hellip]&gt; 10]</code></td>
		<td>b[1…10]</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The same is true if you need a literal square-bracket pair 
surrounding what could be mistaken for a character reference:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>[star]</code></td>
		<td>☆</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>[&gt; star &lt;]</code></td>
		<td>[star]</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<h3>Raw matchertext sequences</h3>

MinML builds on the
<a href="/pub/lang/matchertext/">matchertext</a>
syntactic discipline.
Matchertext makes it possible
to embed one text string into another unambiguously –
within a language or even across languages –
without having to “escape”
or otherwise transform the embedded text.
The cost of this syntactic discipline 
is that the ASCII <dfn>matcher</dfn> characters –
namely the parentheses <code>()</code>,
square brackets <code>[]</code>,
and curly braces <code>{}</code> –
must appear <em>only</em> in properly-nesting matched pairs throughout matchertext.

<p></p>
Let's first look at one of the benefits of matchertext in MinML.
You can use the sequence <code>+[<var>m</var>]</code>
to include any matchertext string <var>m</var> into the markup
as raw literal text,
which is completely uninterpreted except to find its end.
You can use this to include verbatim examples of markup or other code
in your text, for example.
A <code>+[<var>m</var>]</code> sequence
is thus a more concise analog to XML's clunky CDATA sections:

<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>XML</th>
		<th>MinML</th>
		<th>Output</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>&lt;![CDATA[example &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; markup]]&gt;</code></td>
		<td><code>+[example &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; in XML]</code></td>
		<td>example &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; in XML</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>&lt;![CDATA[example b[bold] in MinML]]&gt;</code></td>
		<td><code>+[example b[bold] in MinML]</code></td>
		<td>example b[bold] in MinML</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Unlike CDATA sections,
raw matchertext sequences nest cleanly.
Including a literal example of a CDATA section in XML markup,
for example,
is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA#Nesting">mind-meltingly painful</a>:

<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>XML:</th>
		<td><code>&lt;![CDATA[example &lt;![CDATA[character data]]]]&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&gt; section]]&gt;</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Output:</th>
		<td>example &lt;![CDATA[character data]]&gt; section</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Expressing a literal example
of a raw matchertext sequence <code>+[…]</code> in MinML
is straightforward in contrast:

<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>MinML:</th>
		<td><code>+[example +[matchertext] literal]</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Output:</th>
		<td>example +[matchertext] literal</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<h3>Literal unmatched matchers</h3>

The matchertext discipline has a cost, of course.
If you want to include an <em>unmatched</em> literal
parenthesis, bracket, or curly brace in your MinML markup,
you must “escape” it with a character reference.
You can use standard named or numeric character references,
like <code>[lparen]</code> or <code>[#x28]</code>
for an unmatched left parentheses for example.

<p></p>
MinML also provides an alternative, more visual syntax for unmatched matchers:
<code>[(&lt;)]</code> and <code>[(&gt;)]</code> for an open and close parenthesis,
respectively,
<code>[[&lt;]]</code> and <code>[[&gt;]]</code> for a square bracket, and
<code>[{&lt;}]</code> and <code>[{&gt;}]</code> for a curly brace.
You might think of the <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> symbol in this context
as a stand-in for the unmatched matcher that “points” left or right
at the matcher you actually want.
The following table summarizes these various ways to express
literal unmatched matchers.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th colspan="3">Open</th>
		<th colspan="3">Close</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parentheses <code>()</code></td>
		<td><code>[lpar]</code></td>
		<td><code>[#x28]</code></td>
		<td><code>[(&lt;)]</code></td>
		<td><code>[rpar]</code></td>
		<td><code>[#x29]</code></td>
		<td><code>[(&gt;)]</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Square brackets <code>[]</code></td>
		<td><code>[lbrack]</code></td>
		<td><code>[#x5B]</code></td>
		<td><code>[[&lt;]]</code></td>
		<td><code>[rbrack]</code></td>
		<td><code>[#x5D]</code></td>
		<td><code>[[&gt;]]</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Curly braces <code>{}</code></td>
		<td><code>[lbrace]</code></td>
		<td><code>[#x7B]</code></td>
		<td><code>[{&lt;}]</code></td>
		<td><code>[rbrace]</code></td>
		<td><code>[#x7D]</code></td>
		<td><code>[{&gt;}]</code></td>
	</tr>
</table>

While having to replace unmatched matchers with character references
might seem cumbersome,
they tend not to be used often anyway in most text
(mainly just in text that is <em>talking about</em> such characters).

<p></p>
Independent of the text embedding benefits discussed above,
there another compensation for this small bother.
While editing MinML, or any matchertext language,
you may find that your highlighting text editor
or integrated development environment (IDE)
no longer <em>ever</em> guesses wrong
about which parenthesis, bracket, or brace character
matches which other one in your source file.


<h3>Metasyntax and processing instructions</h3>

SGML-derived markup can contain metasyntactivc <dfn>declarations</dfn>
of the form <code>&lt;!…&gt;</code>,
and <dfn>processing instructions</dfn>
of the form <code>&lt;?…?&gt;</code>.
MiniML provides the syntax
<code>![…]</code> and
<code>?[…]</code>, respectively,
for expressing these constructs if needed.

<p></p>
Since these constructs are typically used
in only a few lines at the beginning of most markup files,
if at all,
improving their syntax is not a high-priority goal for MinML.
Further,
the syntax of – and processing rules for –
document type definitions are frighteningly complex,
even in the “simplified” XML standard.

<p></p>
MiniML therefore leaves the legacy syntax of the underlying markup language
unmodified within the context of these directives.
Only the outermost “wrapper” syntax changes.
For example, a MiniML document based on XML
with a document type declaration might look like:

<pre>	?[xml version="1.0"]
	![DOCTYPE greeting SYSTEM "hello.dtd"]
	greeting[Hello, world!]
</pre>


<h2>Give MinML a try</h2>

There is an 
<a href="https://github.com/dedis/matchertext/tree/main/go/markup/minml">experimental implementation of MinML</a>
in <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a>
that supports parsing into abstract syntax tree (AST) form
and conversion to classic HTML or XML syntax.
This repository also includes a simple
<a href="https://github.com/dedis/matchertext/tree/main/go/markup/minml/cmd">command-line tool</a>
to convert MinML to HTML or XML.

<p></p>
With
<a href="https://github.com/bford/hugo">this experimental fork</a>
of the
<a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> website builder,
you can use MinML source files
with extension <code>.minml</code> or <code>.m</code> in your website.
This blog post was written in MinML and published this way.

<p></p>
If you implement MinML in other languages or applications,
please let me know and I will collect and consolidate links.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

MinML is a new “skin” or outer syntax
for SGML-derived markup languages such as HTML and XML.
MinML preserves all of the base language's power and expressiveness,
unlike the many Markdown-like languages.
MinML's syntax just makes markup a bit more concise
and – at least in this author's opinion –
less annoying to write, read, or edit.
Elements never need end tags, in particular,
only a final close bracket. 
Enjoy!

<!--
Because MinML builds on the 
a{href=/pub/lang/matchertext/}[matchertext],
all constructs including raw literals naturally nest,
and can contain verbatim embedded strings in any compliant language
without escaping or other syntactic contortions.
While this discipline requires unmatched matchers
to be replaced with character references,
...
-->


<!--	Old notes:

Global character rules:
For strict compliance with the standard matchertext configuration,
ALL UCS characters are allowed, unlike XML,
though use of non-whitespace control codes (especially NUL)
are strongly discouraged in working text.


Syntax summary:

tag[content]
	simple tag with nested content but no attributes.
	content can be empty.
tag{attrs}[content] tag with at least one name=val attribute and nested content.

<tag[content]>
	sucks outer whitespace before and after element
<tag[content]
	sucks outer whitespace before only
tag[content]>
	sucks outer whitespace after only
tag[> content <]
	sucks inner whitespace before and after content
tag[> content]
	sucks inner whitespace before content
tag[content <]
	sucks inner whitespace after content

{reference}
	named entity reference
{#...}
	numeric character reference

literal braces around a name that could be mistaken for a reference:
{> name <}
{> name}
{name <}

-[text]
	comment: contents are ignored
+[text]
	raw matchertext: contents uninterpreted except to find the end

![text]
	metasyntax tag like <!DOCTYPE ...>.
	content of DOCTYPE - and all external entities -
	are considered to be in legacy XML syntax
	(if interpreted at all other than to find the end).
?[text]
	system processing tag like <?xml ... ?>
	same raw interpretation as above for ?.


-&#45;

NameStartChar and NameChar classes: exactly follows XML.

EntityValue, AttValue: uses bracket quotes rather than single/double quotes.

SystemLiteral: a slight problem inp rinciple, because in XML disallows
either single or double quotes and doesn't support markup.
But SystemLiteral is to be used to contain a URI,
which has much more restrictive syntax.
Uses URI escaping if escaping is needed.

PubidLiteral: same restricted ASCII-only character set as XML

CharData: removes stilly restriction of no '{c[]}{c[]}>' sequence

Comments: -[...]? or ![...]? or [- ... ]?
Drops the restriction that '-&#45;' must not appear within comments.
Allows character references to appear for escaping or doc-comment purposes.
When converting to XML, '-&#45;' gets escaped with character reference..
If comment text ends in '-', XML writer appends a space
to avoid producing an illegal '-&#45;->' terminator.


entity:
tag[content]
tag{attrs}[content]

!tag[content] or somesuch when tag needs to follow 
name characters with no intervening whitespace?
Or S -tag[...] to consume the preceding whitespace?  conflict: comment syntax
Or <tag[...] to eat left-side whitespace,
tag[...]> to eat right-side whitespace,
<tag[...]> to eat both?
If a literal < is needed immediately before,
it can be done as < <tag[...]; similarly for a literal > immediately after.

or:
[tag content]
[tag{attrs} foo]
?

An open bracket that does not immediately follow a Name
is just treated as a literal open brace.


Processing instructions:
?[...]
Same PITarget syntax.

PI containing '?>' cannot be converted to standard XML
(or would have to be escaped via unknown application escaping syntax).
Converting to MaML must escape unmatched matchers.
Or perhaps just cause a conversion error,
given that the embedded PITarget syntax is effectively unknown
but its constraints are the constraints of the host syntax.


CDATA sections:
get converted to matchertext sections,
massaging the corner cases as needed.
(Both can be broken/combined.)

For example:
#[...]?  @[...]? 
+[...]? (symmetry with -[...] for comments?)



Just disable DTDs entirely?
Protect against XXE attacks https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
Billion Laughs attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack

Another strictly-backward-compatible approach would be
to process all DTDs including internal/external entity references
strictly in legacy XML syntax,
even when used (referred to in) MinML syntax.
Thus, recursive entity expansion works, in XML syntax.
MinXML files are thus processed as if first converted to legacy XML
(without doing any entity expansion at all),
then processed as legacy XML source.

XML is not just a markup language but a way-too-powerful macro language...


Some XML dataset sources for testing:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?res_format=XML
http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/xmltk/xmldata/
https://data.world/datasets/xml


Just convert ![...] to <!...> and handle as legacy XML?


Conditional sections:
INCLUDE is only processed as part of the DTD.  Skip.
IGNORE is ignored.  Skip.
