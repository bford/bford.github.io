&lt;p&gt;XXX intro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;summary of selfish mining&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;selfish mining as a transparency problem:
you get to build on a blockchain head you haven&amp;rsquo;t published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;same as transparency problem in Apple FBI case for example;
that&amp;rsquo;s what CoSi is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;solution: any keyblock you build on is collectively signed,
and the next block&amp;rsquo;s hash covers the last block&amp;rsquo;s signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you withhold a block, you can&amp;rsquo;t get a collective signature on it;
without that collective signature,
you can&amp;rsquo;t secretly mine a next block on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;selfish-mining&#34;&gt;Selfish Mining&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we consider the now much more well-understood problem of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/&#34;&gt;selfish mining&lt;/a&gt;.
A selfish miner strategically withholds some of its successfully mined blocks
in attempt to gain a higher share of mining rewards,
by causing other miners to waste effort mining redundant blocks.
For example, if Greedy Greg successfully mines a new block,
he might deliberately delay announcing it.
If Innocent Ivan announces a competing block,
Greg quickly races to announce and widely distribute his,
which may reliably overtake Ivan&amp;rsquo;s if Greg is fast and well-connected.
Alternatively, if Greg manages to mine a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; block in private
before a competing first block appears,
then Greg is in the enviable position of being able to &amp;ldquo;trump&amp;rdquo;
and eliminate that competing block once it does appear,
simply by revealing his longer private blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ByzCoin&amp;rsquo;s keyblock mining mechanism alone is still
vulnerable to selfish mining,
its microblock commitment process using Byzantine consensus
provides a clean, simple defense against selfish mining.
Any transaction microblock the consensus group commits
contains a cryptographic hash of the latest known keyblock at the time,
and any newly-mined keyblock must similarly contain
a cryptographic hash of a recently-committed microblock
(e.g., within a few microblocks from the head).
Whenever the consensus group commits a new microblock,
all honest members verify that the keyblock pointer in the new microblock
is consistent with those in all prior microblocks,
ensuring that any new keyblock is &amp;ldquo;locked in&amp;rdquo;
irreversably once the new keyblock is known.
This leaves only seconds, rather than minutes,
in which a selfish miner could
try to announce and distribute a competing keyblock.
Further, because each keyblock must reference a recent microblock,
any newly-mined keyblock becomes invalid and useless
if its owner fails to announce it
within a few microblock commitment cycles &amp;mdash;
again, on the order of seconds rather than minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, ByzCoin&amp;rsquo;s microblock commit mechanism
enforces transparency on the keyblock mining process,
ensuring that a selfish ByzCoin miner would likely be faced with
a vanishingly small probability of profiting from
any keyblock-withholding strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post of course represents only an informal,
and no doubt incomplete, analysis
of the differences in incentives between Bitcoin and ByzCoin,
focusing primarily on mining incentives.
It is quite possible that a full, rigorous incentive analysis of ByzCoin
may reveal new incentive-compatibility issues that its architecture introduces.
Further, ByzCoin is still an experimental protocol
under rapid development and evoluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these caveats, however,
ByzCoin&amp;rsquo;s architecture at least appears to be much more resilient
to the known strategic mining attacks against Bitcoin,
whether through block withholding or deliberate forking.
In particular,
by replacing Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s instant-gratification, winner-take-all reward model
with a delayed-gratification, investment-dividend model,
ByzCoin ensures that the distribution of mining profits are fixed
long before any strategic miner might know about or be able to respond to
the appearance of a goose egg or other transaction fee variance.
By ensuring that keyblocks and microblocks track each other cryptographically,
ByzCoin forces miners either to announce new keyblocks quickly
or else lose them,
making selfish mining unprofitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it does not appear necessary for new cryptocurrencies to
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://freedom-to-tinker.com/2016/10/21/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-reward/&#34;&gt;make the block reward permanent and accept monetary inflation
as inevitable&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
as Narayanan suggests.
Whether inflationary or deflationary monetary policies are preferable
is an important and highly debatable question,
but it need not be constrained by technical weaknesses of Bitcoin.
With more sophisticated blockchain architectures such as ByzCoin,
there is plenty of hope that mining incentives can work
independent of monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An advanced crypto library for Go</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;page-title&#34;&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An abstract group arithmetic framework for public-key cryptography
based on the discrete logarithm problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several alternative concrete instantiations of this abstract
group arithmetic framework,
based on the NIST elliptic curve implementations in the Go standard library
and in the OpenSSL crypto library,
and implementations of both generic Edwards curves
and an adaptation of Adam Langley&amp;rsquo;s Ed25519-curve-specific
optimized group arithmetic code to the abstract group API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementations of a number of advanced crypto algorithms
built on this abstract group arithmetic framework,
and hence automatically compatible woth both integer group
and any suitable elliptic curves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shamir Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS),
the standard foundation for t-of-n threshold cryptographic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An implementation of the general Camenisch/Stadler framework
for proofs of knowledge based on the discrete-logarithm problem.
For example&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anonymous and pseudonymous public-key encryption and signatures,
where the sender or receiver are identified only as an anonymous member
of some explicit &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; of public keys, without revealing anything
about which member of the set signed the message or is to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. Andrew Neff&amp;rsquo;s cryptographic protocol for proving
the correctness of a shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Backdoors, Trusted Servers, and Deanonymization</title>
      <link>https://bford.github.io/2016/03/08/backdoors/</link>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;page-title&#34;&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge there are currently only two fundamentally distinct approaches
to achieving strong anonymity online,
and the same legendary computing figure, David Chaum,
pioneered both.
His first approach,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/chaum-mix.pdf&#34;&gt;mixes&lt;/a&gt;,
relay messages over multi-hop paths around the network
to obscure their source and destinations.
State-of-the-art deployed anonymity systems such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;
are highly evolved and performance-optimized variants
of this basic relaying idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaum&amp;rsquo;s second approach,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/chaum-dc.pdf&#34;&gt;dining cryptographers&lt;/a&gt;,
instead uses information-coding principles to hide the sender of a message
among a group of nodes all of whom seem to be spewing gibberish at once.
It&amp;rsquo;s as if you are listening to a crowd
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.christianpublishers.org/Speaking%20in%20Tongues-1.jpg&#34;&gt;speaking in tongues&lt;/a&gt;
but what you hear is a single unified voice,
emanating from no one in particular,
elucidating the Ten Commandments with perfect clarity.
Chaum then moved away from anonymity systems
to other projects such as the first major attempt at practical electronic cash
(yes, he was also the &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; Satoshi Nakamoto),
and secure electronic voting systems.
While several research projects,
including Cornell&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/herbivore/&#34;&gt;Herbivore&lt;/a&gt;
and my own
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/&#34;&gt;Dissent&lt;/a&gt;
have made progress toward making the dining cryptographers practical,
it has not (yet) made it into widely-deployed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Chaum&amp;rsquo;s status as &amp;ldquo;the father of online anonymity&amp;rdquo;,
it stands to reason
that his first venture &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; into anonymity in many years
would get some attention.
Today at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realworldcrypto.com/rwc2016&#34;&gt;Real World Crypto&lt;/a&gt;,
he presented
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/008.pdf&#34;&gt;cMix&lt;/a&gt;,
an interesting new take on the mix approach
that aims to achieve better scalability, lower latencies,
and sufficiently low computation costs on client devices
to be practical for use in energy-conscious mobile phone apps.
I had the pleasure of learning about cMix directly from David
and discussing it with him at some length last year,
but my recent move to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epfl.ch/&#34;&gt;EPFL&lt;/a&gt; and other time demands
prevented me from being able to take a more active role in the project.
The design of cMix is definitely interesting and contains some promising ideas,
but that is not what this blog post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ending-the-crypto-war-or-stoking-the-flames&#34;&gt;Ending the Crypto War, or Stoking the Flames?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier today before Chaum&amp;rsquo;s talk, Wired also released
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2016/01/david-chaum-father-of-online-anonymity-plan-to-end-the-crypto-wars/&#34;&gt;an article on it&lt;/a&gt;
containing a statement that will doubtless attract
a lot more attention than anything in the technical paper on cMix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Chaum is also building into PrivaTegrity another feature that’s sure to be far more controversial: a carefully controlled backdoor that allows anyone doing something “generally recognized as evil” to have their anonymity and privacy stripped altogether.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well before Chaum&amp;rsquo;s talk even began,
Twitter was ablaze with discussion about Chaum&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; in PrivaTegrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The main benefit of Chaum&amp;#39;s new system, as far as I can tell, is that it is a political gift to FBI Director Comey. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/64Au0lXxuL&#34;&gt;https://t.co/64Au0lXxuL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/684730483503149056&#34;&gt;January 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m heartbroken to see that Chaum is proposing key escrow for everyone on the planet: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/zWZ3bUQsJf&#34;&gt;https://t.co/zWZ3bUQsJf&lt;/a&gt; What happened to David Chaum?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/684763375260270592&#34;&gt;January 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-where-s-the-backdoor&#34;&gt;But Where&amp;rsquo;s the Backdoor?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important observation, however, is that the word &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo;
appears nowhere in the actual
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/008.pdf&#34;&gt;technical paper on cMix&lt;/a&gt; written by
Chaum and his collaborators.
While cMix is the anonymous communication protocol Chaum is proposing,
PrivaTegrity is a larger system built on cMix
to provide anonymous chat and other anonymous interaction applications
directly usable to ordinary users.
In essence, cMix is just an &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo; whereas PrivaTegrity is the car.
So where is this supposed &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; &amp;emdash; in the engine or the car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only part of the technical cMix paper that even suggests
the &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; idea (without using that term)
is section IX.B., two brief paragraphs on the paper&amp;rsquo;s second-to-last page.
The first is the most crucial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Independent from cMix, PrivaTegrity addresses potential
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;abuse of anonymity services by establishing a trust model
that offers a balance of anonymity and accountability. On the
one hand, PrivaTegrity aims to provide privacy at a technical
level that is not penetrable by nation states. On the other
hand, PrivaTegrity aims to provide integrity, both prior restraint
and accountability after the fact, that is inescapably tied to
individuals. Only if all of the mixing nodes cooperate, can the
senders and receivers of messages be linked or identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, cMix routes users&amp;rsquo; messages through a series of mixing nodes
(the Wired article talks about nine servers in different countries),
such that none of the servers can individually unmask an anonymous user,
but all of the servers (or their operators) together can unmask a user
that they collectively agree to be deserving of such treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This property is by no means new, unusual, or unique to cMix, however:
in fact a huge number of cryptographic and distributed systems
have this essential security property.
No one really knows how to build secure systems
in which you need to trust &lt;em&gt;no one at all&lt;/em&gt;.
Instead the best we can really do is to &lt;em&gt;split&lt;/em&gt; trust across multiple entities
that we hope are at least somewhat independent,
so that no one entity needs to be fully trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the same security principle that motivates
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deansafe.com/uncodrsawisa.html&#34;&gt;safes with two keys&lt;/a&gt;.
If both keys are required to open the safe and are held by different employees,
then a single dishonest employee working alone will be unable to raid it
without somehow aquiring the other key.
But if the two key-holders conspire,
the two-key mechanism will do nothing to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trust-splitting-in-anonymity-systems&#34;&gt;Trust Splitting in Anonymity Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially all of the practical anonymity systems,
both deployed and proposed in research,
embody this limited trust-splitting property in some fashion.
Several years ago my group
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/eurosec12-abs&#34;&gt;coined the term &amp;ldquo;anytrust&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
for this security model in the context of anonymity systems,
because users need only assume that &amp;ldquo;any one&amp;rdquo; of the servers is honest
and not colluding with all the others against them.
Users don&amp;rsquo;t even need to know or guess which server is honest;
one merely &lt;em&gt;needs to exist&lt;/em&gt;.
Once again, we did not by any means invent this security model;
it has been in use in many ways and under many names for decades
in cryptography and distributed systems practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of the well-known &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; anonymity system,
for example,
depend for their security on a small group of
&lt;em&gt;directory authorities&lt;/em&gt; &amp;emdash;
of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kristovatlas/status/684845884576796673&#34;&gt;there are currently 10&lt;/a&gt; &amp;emdash;
to keep track of and let Tor clients know the set of relays
available to help anonymize their messages.
If &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PrivaTegrity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is Chaum&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; a technical feature?
no, just a common architectural weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tor has it&amp;hellip; (examples)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we eliminate such trusted server groups?  Yes, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does CT fix it?  Not quite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy question: are backdoors needed/good in an anonymity systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would the processes be for controlled deanonymization of a user,
supposing one created a system and set it up like Chaum&amp;rsquo;s
on the (policy) basis that server operators would cooperate
to deanonymize users under &amp;ldquo;the right conditions&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who picks those 9 server operators?  Who funds them?
(The power of the purse is strong&amp;hellip;)
If a nation-state comes to them and says,
&amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ll block your service and thus destroy a big part of your legal business
unless you help us deanonymize these people who we call &amp;lsquo;terrorists&amp;rsquo;
but the rest of the world calls &amp;lsquo;political dissidents&amp;rsquo;&amp;ldquo;,
what do they do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sybil problem, multiple possible levels of response&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s [electoral college defeat]()
has provoked many questions about how so many Americans
could have choosen a
[misogynistic](),
[xenophobic](),
[pathologically lying](),
[authoritarian]()
[ideologue]()
as their next President &amp;ndash;
and one of many targets of their blame is
[social media]().
Compounding its
[polarizing &amp;ldquo;echo chamber&amp;rdquo; effect](),
online discussions were tarnished with
[deliberate misinformation](),
including
[incorrect instructions on how to vote]().
But is the solution for social media companies like Facebook
to ``do a better job&amp;rdquo; at curating the world&amp;rsquo;s content
to suppress out false or hateful speech?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking technology companies
to serve as the world&amp;rsquo;s arbiters of truth and civility
is not only counterproductive but
just as profoundly dangerous as the social maladies
that social media creates or exacerbates.
We need to rethink social media from the ground up
to make it &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; open and transparent, not less &amp;ndash;
and most importantly, to infuse online debate with
some semblance of democratic legitimacy.
The purpose of this blog post is not to dwell on
[the many flaws of social media]()
but to explore how we could get it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would an ethical, secure, and democratic alternative
to either conventional ``elitist&amp;rdquo; media
or the polarizing echo chamber of social media look like?
It would need to be built on a foundation of equality among
all &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people;
it would ensure &lt;em&gt;proportional&lt;/em&gt; speech and accurately expose biases;
it would counteract polarization by ensuring that
all participants are exposed to all viewpoints;
and it would provide strong but proportionate and abuse-resistant
protections for anonymity and free speech &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the ballot box,
in order to head off unpleasant surprises being revealed
only &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;foundation-the-equality-of-real-people&#34;&gt;Foundation: The Equality of &lt;em&gt;Real&lt;/em&gt; People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a story or claim appears with 1,000 ``likes&amp;rdquo;,
how do we know whether 1,000 &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people liked the story,
or only one real troll and his 999 [sock puppet accounts]()?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean all people are equally smart, equally capable, equally right,
or should end up having equal power or influence &lt;em&gt;in the end&lt;/em&gt;.
It means all people should be given an equal &lt;em&gt;starting point&lt;/em&gt;
in apportioning power,
and be free to ``become unequal&amp;rdquo; as their words and actions
are subject to the review of their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to be able to quantify the number of people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a mechanism to ensure that these are &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people we are counting,
not fake accounts created
by whoever has the most time, money, or determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content-based analysis versus account validation.
Content-based analysis [has often proven successful](),
but relies on complex algorithms that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; must keep updating
(and making still more complex)
to keep up with the ``arms race&amp;rdquo;,
as attackers develop more sophisticated algorithms
to farm fake accounts that remain under the detection radar.
Relying on complex algorithms that need to adapt constantly
creates inherent risks that they will become opaque and vulnerable
to accidental bias or deliberate attacks,
such as the secret inclusion of &amp;ldquo;back doors&amp;rdquo; that produces false positives
designed to close the accounts of and hence disenfranchise populations
disfavored by the attacker.
While I believe content-based analysis plays an important scientific role,
it is unsuitable as a &lt;em&gt;foundation&lt;/em&gt; for ensuring the equality of real people
in online public discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;proportional-speech-and-bias-transparency&#34;&gt;Proportional Speech and Bias Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need an objective way to avoid bias,
or clearly and quantitatively expose it when it exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;like wearing blinders&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressuring Mark Zuckerberg to deploy Facebook&amp;rsquo;s minions
to do a better job of censoring fake or misleading social media posts
does not solve the problem,
but instead shifts the power to decide between ultimate truth and falsehood
to precisely the place it does not belong:
to the anonymous employees and proprietary algorithms
of corporations that are accountable to no one but their shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All relevant algorithms need to be public and accountable.
Algorithms need to be as simple as possible
[but no simpler]():
in particular, not so simplistic as to ignore the many lessons
from past failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fake or misleading claim on social media,
as soon as it starts collecting nontrivial interest,
needs to become inextricably attached to the counter-claims that debunk it.
These counter-claims must prominently include
accurate, quantitative evidence that the debunking experts are trustworthy
and not &lt;a href=&#34;Ebell guy&#34;&gt;paid lobbyists masquerading as scientists&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash;
together with accurate quantitative measures of the number of people
(&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; people) who support the false statement despite its being debunked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when people are willing to hear viewpoints they don&amp;rsquo;t like,
there is a matter of scalability:
everyone simply does not have time to listen to everything everyone else says.
Speech needs to be filtered or summarized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;anonymity-and-free-speech-before-the-ballot-box&#34;&gt;Anonymity and Free Speech &lt;em&gt;Before&lt;/em&gt; the Ballot Box&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of many explanations, possibly contributing but probably not only factor&amp;hellip;
other explanations include
[normal polling errors](),
[hacking of the election system](),
[the FBI](), &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Trump supporters are certainly racist and xenophobic;
most of them are probably not,
but voted Trump for other reasons.
In order to protect our civilization,
we the people need to be fully aware of size and malignancy of
any malignancy affecting it:
you do not beat a cancerous tumor by ignoring it
or sanitizing the doctor&amp;rsquo;s diagnosis.
We need &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the true, complex set of reasons that
people are inclined to support someone like Trump&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need regular opportunities for speech
ensuring that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; voices are represented,
and [building anger over policies]()
actually have [a chance to influence policy]()
before that anger
explodes in a self-defeating electoral choice
of an [authoritarian]() [con-artist]()
and [places freedom and democracy in existential risk]().&lt;/p&gt;
