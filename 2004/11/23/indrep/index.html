      <h1>Individual Representation</h1>

      
<h3>Real Choice for Voters, Democratic Currency for Activists</h3>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

The traditional purpose of popular elections
is primarily to elect candidates to government offices or legislative seats,
but this is not the only way we could use elections
to facilitate democracy.
<!---
Popular elections also sometimes enable voters
to participate directly in certain decisions
via initiative, referendum, or recall.
--->
Individual Representation, or <i>indrep</i>,
provides a new and different reason to hold popular elections:
as a tool for directly promoting the growth of
grassroots social and political relationships
throughout the basic fabric of society.
An indrep election enables ordinary people,
who often have insufficient time, interest, or knowledge
to be politically or socially active themselves,
to vote for periodically and thereby reward
other politically or socially active people they know personally
and would like to support.
An activist participating as a "candidate" or <i>delegate</i>
in an indrep election does not "win" or "lose" any office,
but instead receives quantifiable democratic "credentials" from the election:
a certified count
of the number of voters the activist was able to mobilize
behind his cause or platform in that election.
A participating activist may also receive a small monetary reward
proportional to the number of voters he was able to mobilize.

<p>
The "credentials" an activist receives from an indrep election
serves as a democratically legitimate measure
of the size of his public support base,
bolstering his status among peers
and giving him the ability to prove public backing for his platform
when arguing in public forums.
In effect, democratic credentials can help activists
who truly represent the will of a community
to distinguish themselves from the common "vocal nut."
Ordinary voters
who do not have the time or inclination to be activists,
in turn,
gain the ability to support their activist friends
in a way that requires very little personal time and no money.
Indrep elections give activists
a greater incentive to court and develop direct personal relationships
with the ordinary, non-political people in their communities and social circles,
and to keep potential voters in <i>all</i> elections
personally informed and educated
about important developments
that the voters themselves may not have the time or inclination to follow.
Voters in turn
receive a truly unrestricted, <i>individual</i> choice
of activists who can represent their views or interests in public debates,
and thus can make their true preferences known
in a fashion impossible with conventional electoral competitions
between just two or three viable candidates.
As an added benefit of participation,
voters are also far more likely to receive <i>individual</i> attention
from the activists they support
than they would from traditional "mass market" career politicians.
Hence <i>individual representation</i>.

<h1>How it Works</h1></a>

<p>
Indrep elections work much like ordinary popular elections,
except that they require no official government support
and are typically run by independent non-profit organizations.
Indrep elections are held periodically,
perhaps once or twice a year,
on dates that may or may not have any relationship
to the dates of regular government-sponsored elections.
Activists who wish to participate in the election
register themselves with the election commission as <i>delegates</i>,
or "candidates" competing for popular votes but not for public office.
Delegates are then responsible for promoting themselves and their platforms
among friends, supporters, or the public at large,
and persuading their supporters to vote
in both indrep and traditional elections.
There are no prerequisites to becoming a delegate
other than an ability and commitment to follow the rules of the election:
anyone can become a delegate even having no existing support base
other than him- or herself.

<p>
On "indrep election day",
participating voters show up in person
at designated polling locations,
and each person is allowed to cast a single vote
for any delegate they choose.
Since delegates are not running for a particular office,
voters are expected to vote for a delegate
on a basis of how well the delegate
generally represents them and their viewpoints,
and on whether they consider the delegate personally trustworthy,
rather than on how qualified they think the delegate is for a particular job.
As in conventional popular elections, voting is fully anonymous.
Since each voter has only a single choice to make,
rather than one for each of several public offices or initiatives,
indrep elections are extremely simple, quick, and cheap to implement.
Nevertheless, the low barrier to participation as a delegate
gives voters a broad range of options
in making that one choice:
voters are much more likely than in traditional elections
to find a candidate whose platform they really agree with,
and who they may even know personally.

<p>
Since indrep delegates are likely to be
socially much closer to individual voters
than traditional candidates for public office,
and are more likely to campaign person-to-person in local areas
than to spend millions on mass-media campaigns,
voters are much more likely to meet delegates in person
both before and during elections.
An indrep election may thus strike voters
much more like a social event or a "political bazaar"
than a traditional dry, impersonal government-run election.
Even a voter with no prior knowledge or contacts
can simply show up at an indrep election,
chat in person with delegates present at that polling location,
make a decision about whom to support,
and cast a vote immediately.
Delegates at indrep elections are allowed and encouraged
to facilitate political dialogue
using time-tested social lubricants such as pizza and beer.

<p>
After an indrep election is over,
the election commission counts the number of votes cast
for each registered delegate,
publicizes these totals on a master list on the Internet and elsewhere,
and gives each delegate an official certificate
stating the delegate's vote totals for that election
(and perhaps historically for a few prior elections,
if the candidate has been around for a while).
These certificates
provide delegates with informal
but legitimate and verifiable "democratic credentials"
with which they can prove the size of their support base at any time.
Delegates thus compete with each other for individual votes,
but do not "win" or "lose" in the election.
Instead, all delegates "win"; merely to varying degrees.
While a delegate's credentials
do not confer political power in any formal sense,
they give delegates some amount public legitimacy and prestige,
and can help delegates prove that they have a support base
and are not merely lone "vocal nuts"
while arguing in a public forum.
Delegates thinking of running for official public offices
can use their indrep credentials to negotiate
for the support of other activists,
and indrep voters represent a valuable network of contacts
from which delegates might solicit nomination signatures, donations,
or other secondary forms of campaign support.

<p>
Besides providing a status symbol for activists,
indrep election results will be used
to run the indrep election commissions themselves democratically,
allowing delegates to participate in decisions
as representatives of themselves and their individual supporters.
Other organizations,
such as the party- or issue-oriented organizations
in which particular activists normally work,
are similarly free to make use of indrep election results
in their own operational procedures if they choose to.

<p>
An independently-managed fund might be set up
to reward activists participating in an indrep election
with cash prizes directly proportional
to the support base they mobilize in the election.
The fund would enable philanthropic donors
to help promote the advancement of democracy and social activism
in a truly neutral and evenhanded fashion,
as an alternative or supplement to donating to particular causes of interest.
Although the resulting cash prizes would tend to remain small on average
due to the low barrier to participation
and hence high "dilution" of any available funds,
even small prizes could encourage and significantly reward
activists in poor or otherwise disadvantaged communities -
and these are often precisely the communities
most in need of such encouragement.

<h1>Benefits of Individual Representation</h1></a>

Indrep benefits social and political activists as follows:
<ul>
<li>	Indrep elections publicly reward activists
	for mobilizing ordinary people to participate in political processes.
<li>	Election results gives activists
	a reliably and quantifiable "democratic currency"
	representing the size of their popular support base.
	This currency can increase the activists' perceived legitimacy
	and the effective power of their voice,
	in the eyes of both elected officials and the public at large.
<li>	Activists thinking of running for public office
	can develop their popular support base through indrep elections
	as a way to "get a foot in the door",
	gradually building the political recognition
	and support networks they need
	to obtain nominations for offices and other campaign support.
</ul>

Indrep benefits ordinary people as follows:
<ul>
<li>	By giving activists an incentive to court voters all the time
	rather than just during some crucial election campaign,
	voters may receive more personal one-on-one attention
	from activists and local representatives they support.

<li>	Voters can use activists they trust and identify with
	as "political ombudsmen"
	from which to obtain information and advice
	regarding governmental elections or other social and political issues.

<li>	Indrep elections could resurrect the now long-dead notion
	of elections themselves serving as a social gathering:
	a place and time where people can meet others in the neighborhood
	having similar or different viewpoints,
	discuss important issues,
	or just make new friends.
</ul>

Indrep can even benefit existing and future holders of political offices:
<ul>
<li>	A delegate's support base in an indrep election
	provides a starting point for building a support base
	for candidacy to a formal political office.

<li>	Political office holders
	can use indrep election results
	as an inexpensive alternative to classic opinion polls,
	to gauge public sentiments on important issues.

<li>	Even established politicians may find
	indrep delegates with substantial voter support bases
	to be highly valuable resources in winning contested elections:
	if an activist can convince a group of voters
	to vote for them in an election
	that has no <i>formal</i> political significance,
	the same activist can probably convince the same group of voters
	to come vote in an election that "really matters."
</ul>

<p>
Overall, individual representation also benefits society as a whole:
<ul>
<li>	Indrep elections may act as a catalyst
	helping people establish grassroots, person-to-person
	social and political relationships.

<li>	Indrep elections can provide a new forum facilitating
	meaningful social interaction and political dialog
	among different groups and viewpoints.

<li>	Indrep elections could provide a safe venue
	for experimenting with and putting into practice
	novel forms of democratic decision-making,
	such as
	<a href="http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/">
	delegative democracy</a>.

<h1>Election Process Details</h1></a>

<p>
This project is still in its formative stages,
and thus all of its details are open to revision.
Nevertheless, this section lays out a useful starting point.

<h2>Election Frequency</h2>

<p>
Indrep elections should be held
more frequently than regular governmental elections,
since their purpose is to establish and maintain
grassroots social and political ties on a continuing basis
and not just when government offices are up for election.
Elections should not be held so frequently as to become mundane, however -
they should ideally evolve into
a special, festive social occasion like a community holiday party.
It might be appropriate to hold indrep elections
once every six months initially
during a short "starting period" of a year or two
to build momentum in a particular area,
and then hold elections once a year thereafter.

<h2>An International Institution</h2>

<p>
Indrep elections might initially be organized and run
completely independently from one city, region, or country to another.
Once established, however,
indrep election commissions
should cooperate globally and attempt to converge over time
on a single, standard yearly election date (an "International Voting Day"?),
and a standard set of procedures and rules
that would allow any voter to support any registered delegate in the system
regardless of their respective citizenship or location of residence.
For example, an American vacationing in Europe on election day
could simply drop by the nearest polling location in Europe
to cast a vote for his favorite delegate back in the States.
Unlike conventional elections driven by national governments,
indrep elections could over time become a truly global institution.

<p>
Voters might be given the option to state on their ballots
their citizenship/location of residence
and eligibility to vote in governmental elections for that location.
The indrep election commission could then use this information
to calculate for each delegate
not only an all-inclusive measure of general public support,
but also a measure of support specifically among people
eligible to vote in governmental elections
at a particular location of interest.

<h2>Voting Procedures</h2>

<p>
To make them truly international,
indrep elections should only use voting procedures and technologies
that can be implemented cheaply and reliably
anywhere in the world
where there is sufficient stability and political freedom.
Elections must therefore stick to simple, inexpensive, and low-tech methods
of enforcing the "one person, one vote" rule,
such as the indelible ink method typically used in third-world countries
where voter registration is impractical.

<p>
Since each voter ultimately has only one choice to make in an indrep election,
balloting and vote counting can be made very simply and inexpensive,
which is obviously important for elections
that will probably have to be funded by donations and staffed by volunteers.
Each delegate might be required to print,
register with the election commision,
and distribute to his supporters
a flyer having a standard size and format,
and showing the delegate's name, picture,
and a summary of his platform.
These flyers then double as ballots for that delegate.
After a voter enters the election area
and receives his "indelible ink mark",
the election officers also give him a validation sticker.
The voter attaches this sticker to the flyer for the delegate of his choice
before dropping it into the ballot box.
When the box is opened after the election,
only flyers with the appropriate validation sticker are counted.
This way,
the only per-voter election materials
that the election commission itself must purchase
are the inexpensive validation stickers.
Alternatively, ordinary letter envelopes
with a unique printed design or stamp
might be used instead of stickers for ballot validation.

<!---
<h2>Possible Variations</h2>

<p>
One obvious variation
would be to allow each voter to cast some number of votes,
say up to three,
so he can split his vote and support multiple delegates at once.
But this may introduce more expense and complexity than it's worth.
