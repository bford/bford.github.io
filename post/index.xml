      <title>So They&#39;re Selling You a Blockchain</title>

      <description>Blockchain is certainly one of the hot technology topics today. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s probably in part a hype bubble &amp;ndash; but from my perspective as a long-time researcher in decentralized systems I believe there is also a lot of potential value in the concept, which is why my DEDIS lab at EPFL has been investing years of effort in building next generation blockchain architectures. I also believe the value of the blockchain concept is relatively independent of the unpredictable and scam-riddled financial market for cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>International Scientific Conferences Must Leave the U.S.</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2018/06/27/muslim-ban/</link>

      <description>So the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld Trump&amp;rsquo;s so-called &amp;ldquo;travel ban&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; more honestly labeled a Muslim ban. More precisely, it is a ban on people from Muslim-majority countries not hosting Trump business properties (see map and fact check).
Where to Hold Conferences? This development naturally and rightfully raises again to prominence the question of where responsible scientists should hold their international conferences. We may soon see renewed calls to boycott US-based conferences, in solidarity with the many scientists around the world who can no longer attend conferences held in the U.</description>

      <title>Sightseeing Around Lausanne</title>

      <description>For the benefit those visiting but not yet familiar with EPFL, Lausanne, or other parts of the Lake Geneva Region, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a quick summary of some of my personal favorite places and sights in the area. This is completely my personal perspective; I make no pretense at being objective or unbiased here and am not trying to write a proper travel guide. But with that in mind, I hope you might find something interesting here.</description>

      <title>How Do You Know It&#39;s On the Blockchain? With a SkipChain.</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2017/08/01/skipchain/</link>

      <description>A blockchain, or distributed ledger, is a log maintained collectively by a distributed group of participants who agree on and record transactions without relying for security on any single trusted party. While initially popularized by Bitcoin and its derivatives, the blockchain abstraction is not specific to currencies, and there is exploding industry interest in many non-currency uses.
 
Many of these diverse use-cases, however, require users to be able to verify whether or not some transaction has been committed to a blockchain.</description>

      <title>Technology Governs Us. Will it Govern Us Well?</title>

      <description>This blog post is a transcript of my opening remarks on the panel &amp;ldquo;Restoring Personal Privacy without Compromising National Security&amp;rdquo; at the 50 Years of the ACM Turing Award Celebration. 
We now live in a world in which the rules coded into the technology we use plays as important a role in governing our lives as the formal laws written in the public law books. Code is law already, for better or worse.</description>

      <title>Untangling Mining Incentives in Bitcoin and ByzCoin</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2016/10/25/mining/</link>

      <description>--  
As the first widely-deployed cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has proven hugely successful and inspired a blockchain fever (or is it a bubble?). Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s security and economic assumptions are showing significant fractures, however. Following previously-identified selfish mining and stubborn mining attacks, new research from Princeton being presented at CCS identifies further incentive weaknesses that appear as transaction fees supplant block rewards as the primary incentive for mining.
In short, miners motivated by transaction fees have even greater incentive to deviate strategically from the standard Bitcoin protocol in selfish and potentially destructive ways.</description>

      <title>Apple, FBI, and Software Transparency</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2016/03/10/apple/</link>

      <description>This post originally appeared on the Freedom to Tinker blog by the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. 
The Apple versus FBI showdown has quickly become a crucial flashpoint of the &amp;ldquo;new Crypto War.&amp;rdquo; On February 16 the FBI invoked the All Writs Act of 1789, a catch-all authority for assistance of law enforcement, demanding that Apple create a custom version of its iOS to help the FBI decrypt an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.</description>

      <title>Let&#39;s verify real people, not real names.</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2015/10/07/names.html</link>

      <description>On Monday the EFF, together with a &amp;ldquo;Nameless Coalition&amp;rdquo; of like-minded groups, escalated the backlash against Facebook&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;real names&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;authentic identities&amp;rdquo; policy with an open letter urging Facebook to end this policy like Google Plus did last year. Facebook&amp;rsquo;s response cites concerns about pseudonyms helping to hide &amp;ldquo;terrorist organizations&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;school bullies&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;criminal behavior.&amp;rdquo;
While I support anonymity and have spent years working to strengthen it, terrorist fearmongering aside, Facebook is right that anonymity is often abused.</description>

      <title>Delegative Democracy Revisited</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2014/11/16/deleg.html</link>

      <description>Over a decade ago I wrote up some ideas I called &amp;ldquo;Delegative Democracy,&amp;rdquo; which has also become known as &amp;ldquo;Liquid Democracy.&amp;rdquo; My draft paper from 2002 took a first stab at laying out the general idea, though I never finished or tried to publish it. Since a lot has happened in this space since then, and I get regular inquiries about it, I thought it was high time to revisit the idea and review more recent developments.</description>

      <title>Faculty size and growth in the top 20 Computer Science departments</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2014/10/22/cs-growth.html</link>

      <description>Yesterday the Yale Daily News ran an article on our CS department&amp;rsquo;s faculty shortage, which generated some discussion among CS colleagues. Yale&amp;rsquo;s CS faculty shortage is not really news: for example, another YDN article over a year ago made basically the same point, and that probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first.
Setting aside Yale in particular, however, it is interesting to notice some broader trends in CS department growth. So here are a couple charts I recently put together.</description>
