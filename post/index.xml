      <description>

&lt;p&gt;On Monday the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/&#34;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt;,
together with a &amp;ldquo;Nameless Coalition&amp;rdquo; of like-minded groups,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/global-coalition-facebook-authentic-names-are-authentically-dangerous-your-users&#34;&gt;escalated the backlash&lt;/a&gt;
against
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576&#34;&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;real names&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;authentic identities&amp;rdquo; policy&lt;/a&gt;
with an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-facebook-about-its-real-names-policy&#34;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;
urging Facebook to end this policy
like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/07/17/google_plus_finally_ditches_its_ineffective_dangerous_real_name_policy.html&#34;&gt;Google Plus did last year&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/nameless-coalition-petitions-facebook-to-rethink-its-real-name-policy&#34;&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s response&lt;/a&gt;
cites concerns about pseudonyms helping to hide
&amp;ldquo;terrorist organizations&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;school bullies&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;criminal behavior.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I support anonymity and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192387-seeking-anonymity-in-an-internet-panopticon/fulltext&#34;&gt;have spent years working to strengthen it&lt;/a&gt;,
terrorist fearmongering aside,
Facebook is right that anonymity is often abused.
Pseudonym-friendly Twitter constantly
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/04/twitter-abuse/&#34;&gt;struggles with trolls&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win/&#34;&gt;has&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/27/twitter-trolls-threats-bank-notes-austen&#34;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mashable.com/2012/11/09/twitter-sports-trolls/#_0rIFtoO8gqI&#34;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;.
Ironically, such abuse has even
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/03/privacy-advocates-unmask-twitter-troll&#34;&gt;led die-hard anonymity advocates to
de-anonymize trolls&lt;/a&gt;.
And even Twitter&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/03/hey-twitter-killing-anonymitys-dumb-way-fight-trolls/&#34;&gt;demands for phone number verification&lt;/a&gt;
rankle users desiring the stronger anonymity provided by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;.
Online services seemingly face a zero-sum choice
between protecting people who have legitimate needs for anonymity,
and protecting everyone else from those who abuse anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a false choice,
because most of an abuser&amp;rsquo;s power comes not from having &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; pseudonym,
but from having &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;.
Abuse using an army of fake identities is known as
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/wikipedia-sockpuppet-investigation-largest-network-history-wiki-pr/&#34;&gt;sockpuppetry on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;,
or in computer science as a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com:8082/pubs/74220/IPTPS2002.pdf&#34;&gt;Sybil attack&lt;/a&gt;
after a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_(book)&#34;&gt;famous psychiatric case&lt;/a&gt;.
The security benefit Facebook arguably derives
from asking suspect users to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/319547548123767&#34;&gt;confirm their identity&lt;/a&gt;
has little to do with actually knowing the user&amp;rsquo;s real name:
is Facebook going to decide that an &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rdquo; is more trustworthy than a &amp;ldquo;Bob&amp;rdquo;?
On the contrary, the perceived security benefit
has everything to do with verifying that the user is a real &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;
controlling only that one account.
But what if online services could verify that a user is a real &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;
without intrusively demanding to know the user&amp;rsquo;s real &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pseudonym-parties:fe23a20afac7e671a2c3615c89cb68a9&#34;&gt;Pseudonym Parties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago I
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bford.info/pub/net/sybil.pdf&#34;&gt;proposed a possible solution&lt;/a&gt;
that I believe a determined group of activists like the Nameless Coalition
could readily put into practice on a grassroots budget
and with only minimal buy-in from industry.
The idea is simple:
Once a year, organizers in participating cities and towns host an event
to which anyone may show up in person and obtain a cryptographic token,
which might be simply a random-looking number printed on a slip of paper.
This token carries no identity information whatsoever,
but merely attests that the holder is a &lt;em&gt;real person&lt;/em&gt;.
The holder can subsequently use this token
to register or confirm pseudonymous accounts
with participating online services throughout the subsequent year.
Pseudonym party attendees need not show any ID,
and would even be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Venice&#34;&gt;welcome to wear masks&lt;/a&gt;,
but everyone would receive an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_ink&#34;&gt;indelible ink mark&lt;/a&gt;
making it difficult for cheaters to acquire several tokens the same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each token enables the holder to register pseudonymous accounts
at many online services,
but &lt;em&gt;only one account&lt;/em&gt; per service.
If the user abuses this one account, the service can shut it down,
and be assured that the abuser will be unable to obtain
another token-verified account until next year.
The main amplication power of anonymous abuse,
through Sybil attacks or sockpuppetry,
would be neutralized without the online service
having to know anything else about the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-people-not-real-names:fe23a20afac7e671a2c3615c89cb68a9&#34;&gt;Real People, Not Real Names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokens distributed at pseudonym parties
would effectively enable online services to verify
that users are real people without verifying their real names.
For example, Facebook could add token-based verification
as a fourth alternative to their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/help/159096464162185&#34;&gt;three current ID-based verification options&lt;/a&gt;.
Would they?
That&amp;rsquo;s up to Facebook, but even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t,
other online services might do so as a way to
compete by presenting a more privacy-friendly image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least for now,
there is no reason to expect that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; should be expected
to attend pseudonym parties and obtain tokens each year,
only users who particularly care about their privacy
or have specific need for an alternative
to ID-based account verification.
As a result, the costs of organizing pseudonym parties
should start small, grow gradually with user demand,
and remain within the reach of nonprofit, donation-funded budgets.
Pseudonym party locations would initially be few and far between,
but would also serve as opportunities to organize, celebrate, and meet
other privacy-minded people in the region.
If the idea were successful and proved sustainable
in a few cities,
and even just a few privacy-minded online services
decided to support account verification via tokens,
this would help build critical mass to open more locations
and pressure other online services
to support ID-free account verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nameless Coalition is absolutely right to critique
Facebook&amp;rsquo;s real names policy and the problems it creates
for more vulnerable and privacy-sensitive users.
But the Coalition should also acknowledge the difficult tradeoffs
&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; online services currently face
between protecting their users&amp;rsquo; privacy
and protecting their users from anonymous abuse.
Instead of treating this problem as a zero-sum cultural tug-of-war,
we must give online services a means to verify
that users are real people without having to check their real names &amp;mdash;
and we should not wait for industry or government to take the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delegative Democracy Revisited</title>
      <link>http://bford.github.io/2014/11/16/deleg.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bford.github.io/2014/11/16/deleg.html</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Over a decade ago I wrote up some ideas
I called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/&#34;&gt;Delegative Democracy&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo;
which has also become known as
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://p2pfoundation.net/Liquid_Democracy&#34;&gt;Liquid Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
My &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/deleg.pdf&#34;&gt;draft paper from 2002&lt;/a&gt;
took a first stab at laying out the general idea,
though I never finished or tried to publish it.
Since a lot has happened in this space since then,
and I get regular inquiries about it,
I thought it was high time to revisit the idea
and review more recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-basic-idea:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;The Basic Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people including myself like the participatory ideal embodied in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy&#34;&gt;direct democracy&lt;/a&gt;,
but this ideal does not readily scale beyond small communities.
As I will shortly be moving to &lt;a href=&#34;http://epfl.ch&#34;&gt;EPFL&lt;/a&gt;,
I look forward to learning first-hand
how the Swiss make direct democracy work for them &amp;mdash;
but Switzerland is a small country divided into even smaller,
fairly autonomous cantons.
A basic criticism of direct democracy is that
expecting that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; eligible voter to
attend &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the meetings and keep up with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the issues,
rather than actually getting more people involved,
may instead disenfranchise those without infinite spare time or patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delegative democracy attempts to make direct democracy scale,
by allowing anyone who cannot participate directly in a particular vote
to &lt;em&gt;delegate&lt;/em&gt; their vote to someone they trust
to participate and vote on their behalf.
This process may be viewed as a mechanized equivalent
of seeking advice from a friend and voting based on that advice.
Delegative democracy differs from representative democracy
in the principle that each voter should have free, &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;
choice of their delegate &amp;mdash;
not just a choice among a restricted set of career politicians &amp;mdash;
just as we already make a free, individual choice of our friends.
Further, voters may choose to participate in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; meetings directly,
overriding their delegate&amp;rsquo;s choices in those meetings,
and voters may revoke or change their delegation at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While corporate governance practice often allows the related idea of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting&#34;&gt;proxy voting&lt;/a&gt;,
a proxy vote often amounts to a &amp;ldquo;pre-packaged mandate&amp;rdquo;:
e.g., a directive to cast an unconditional YES or NO vote on my behalf
regardless of what new information might be presented at the meeting
or what discussion might ensue.
The spirit of delegative democracy is closer to representative democracy,
in that delegation is not about delivering my &amp;ldquo;canned decision&amp;rdquo;
but about asking my trusted delegate to &lt;em&gt;participate&lt;/em&gt;
in the full deliberative process on my behalf.
My delegate can and is expected to listen and engage in the debate,
consider the information available,
and make what his views as the best decision on that basis.
If I dislike his decision,
I can choose a different delegate before the next vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins-of-the-idea:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Origins of the Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly,
I was only one of many people to think along these lines over the decades.
In Lewis Carrol&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCovAAAAYAAJ&#34;&gt;Principles of Parliamentary Representation&lt;/a&gt;
of 1884,
candidates could &amp;ldquo;club&amp;rdquo; their votes together,
allowing a candidate who received more votes than required to win a seat
to delegate the &amp;ldquo;excess&amp;rdquo; votes toward the election of other candidates.
James C. Miller in 1969 foresaw electronic voting and proposed a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01718736&#34;&gt;delegate proxy voting scheme&lt;/a&gt;,
to enable more widespread &amp;mdash; and more propoportional &amp;mdash;
representation in political decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting around 2002
the Internet exploded with reinventions
of this and similar ideas.
Besides my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/deleg.pdf&#34;&gt;Delegative Democracy&lt;/a&gt; proposal,
there was
Dennis Lomax&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20031220012108/www.beyondpolitics.org/Beyond_Politics_Intro.htm&#34;&gt;Beyond Politics&lt;/a&gt;,
Jio Ito&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracyPaper&#34;&gt;Emergent Democracy&lt;/a&gt;,
Sayke&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20040616144517/http://www.twiste
dmatrix.com/wiki/python/LiquidDemocracy&#34;&gt;Liquid Democracy&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20040518131300/http://twistedmatrix.com/wiki/python/LiquidDemocracyVotingSystem&#34;&gt;voting system&lt;/a&gt;,
Mikael Nordfors&amp;rsquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/politics_Democracy2.1&#34;&gt;Democracy 2.1&lt;/a&gt;,
James Green-Armytage&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090528052745/http://fc.antioch.edu/~james_green-armytage/vm/proxy.htm&#34;&gt;delegable proxy system&lt;/a&gt;, and
Mark Rosst&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newciv.org/nl/newslog.php/_v45/__show_article/_a000009-000320.htm&#34;&gt;Structural Deep Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.
The idea of allowing voters to delegate their participation
to individually-chosen representatives
is central to all of these proposals, though details differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic-research:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Academic Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration of this idea in the academic literature has been more sparse,
no doubt in part because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to convince reviewers of the novelty
of an idea that&amp;rsquo;s been around in some form since the 1880s or 1960s,
depending on how you count.
However, Rodriguez et al&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://public.lanl.gov/jhw/Jen/Publications_files/Smarto-Share.pdf&#34;&gt;Smartocracy&lt;/a&gt;
develops a trust network and decision ranking algorithm
embodying a form of delegative democracy.
Paolo Boldi et al developed
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-kdd.isti.cnr.it/~bonchi/votingSN.pdf&#34;&gt;Viscous Democracy&lt;/a&gt;,
a transitive proxy voting algorithm
based on Google&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf&#34;&gt;PageRank&lt;/a&gt;
and in a vein similar to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sd-2/&#34;&gt;Structural Deep Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.
Wybo Wiersma explored the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wybowiersma.net/pub/AltFutures2013/Wiersma,Wybo,Transitive_delegative_democracy_through_Facebook.pdf&#34;&gt;integration of delegative democracy into social networking systems&lt;/a&gt; such as FaceBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking an economics perspective,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://inside.bard.edu/~armytage/research.html&#34;&gt;James Green-Armytage&lt;/a&gt;
has developed an
&lt;a href=&#34;http://inside.bard.edu/~armytage/proxy.pdf&#34;&gt;axiomatic model and analysis&lt;/a&gt;
of delegate proxy voting systems.
His work formally models the
&lt;em&gt;expressive loss&lt;/em&gt; of alternative voting systems &amp;mdash;
the collective decision-making &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; induced by voters who may have
limited information about issues and/or
limited choices of possible representatives.
This analysis mathematically confirms the intuition motivating
all the incarnations of delegative democracy:
namely, that &lt;em&gt;voluntary&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; choice of delegation
yields decisions with no more error (and most likely less)
than conventional alternatives such as direct or representative democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yefim Leifman has explored ways to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/351.pdf&#34;&gt;implement transitive delegation schemes
using cryptography&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a topic I am particularly interested in as well,
since a major motivation for my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/&#34;&gt;Dissent project&lt;/a&gt;
was to build practical anonymous communication systems
that would be good not only for &lt;em&gt;communication&lt;/em&gt;
but also for secure &lt;em&gt;deliberation&lt;/em&gt; mechanisms such as voting.
I hope more system-builders and security/privacy researchers
will be bold enough to venture into this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;delegative-liquid-democracy-in-the-real-world:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Delegative/Liquid Democracy in the Real World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing participation and engagement in political discourse
has long been a basic goal of many Internet democracy efforts.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://demoex.org&#34;&gt;Demoex&lt;/a&gt;,
an experiment to build political parties based on online direct democracy,
succeeded in Sweeden from 2002
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pernor.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;until this year&lt;/a&gt;,
as recounted in
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A414T9I&#34;&gt;The Little Horse from Athens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
by Per Norbäck.
While Demoex pursued something closer to traditional direct democracy,
it relied heavily on online participation
and made provision for voters to obtain voting advice from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most exciting development is that
starting around 2006,
free software organizations in Germany began building
two different software platforms for delegation-based
online discussion and deliberation:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://liquidfeedback.org&#34;&gt;LiquidFeedback&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adhocracy.de&#34;&gt;Adhocracy&lt;/a&gt;.
LiquidFeedback was adopted and used for the past several years by the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_Germany&#34;&gt;German Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt;,
as recounted in an
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.liquid-democracy-journal.org/issue/1/The_Liquid_Democracy_Journal-Issue001-02-Five_years_of_Liquid_Democracy_in_Germany.html&#34;&gt;article by Björn Swierczek&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.liquid-democracy-journal.org/issue/1/The_Liquid_Democracy_Journal-Issue001-03-Fuenf_Jahre_Liquid_Democracy_in_Deutschland.html&#34;&gt;original German version&lt;/a&gt;).
Further information on these tools and their adoption is now available in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://principles.liquidfeedback.org&#34;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.liquid-democracy-journal.org&#34;&gt;an electronic journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These success stories with delegative democracy in Germany
have started to get noticed and studied internationally.
Articles in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/liquid-democracy-web-platform-makes-professor-most-powerful-pirate-a-818683.html&#34;&gt;Spiegel&lt;/a&gt; and

recently covered the party&amp;rsquo;s attempt at a foothold in the US.
There are academic studies of the Pirate Party&amp;rsquo;s use of Liquid Democracy

at the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ma-politikmanagement.de&#34;&gt;NRW School of Governance&lt;/a&gt;
recently interviewed me as part of her thesis studying liquid democracy;
I look forward to seeing the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-to-next:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Where To Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe strongly in the idea of delegative democracy,
regardless of what we decide to call it.
Participatory approaches to democracy are important because they address
a fundamental security flaw in representative democracy,
which in practice allows small groups of elite political insiders
to control and limit voting to choices
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Helen_Keller&#34;&gt;between Tweedledum and Tweedledee&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
Delegation is important because it addresses
a basic scaling flaw of direct democracy,
which becomes a critical security flaw
once those members of a community with other demands
on their time and attention
are drowned out and driven away by a vocal minority
with the time and determination to do nothing but push their agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see delegation as just one of many improvements needed
to address scaling and security weaknesses
in traditional democratic processes, however.
I am concerned that current tools for delegative democracy
appear to be designed with limited attention to other security concerns.
The current tools depend on a single centralized server
that all users must simply trust,
and offer no cryptographic protections
either to ensure the integrity of the deliberation process,
or to offer privacy, anonymity, or coercion-resistance to voting users.
All of these issues and many others, if inadequately addressed,
could easily become &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; but equally critical security flaws
in the overall deliberative process
as it scales up and meets real-world adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this comment by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/uid:26945&#34;&gt;godix&lt;/a&gt; in a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/7/16/201556/896&#34;&gt;a kuro5hin discussion&lt;/a&gt;
to be both amusing and apt. [sic]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can easily see the following quotes if this idea ever took hold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Congradulations on your new high paying job at monolithic multinational
  corperation. Just a few forms to fill out and you&amp;rsquo;ll be earning three
  figures. First off is the tax form, next is your health insurance, then
  we&amp;rsquo;ll be needing to you proxy your vote to the CEO&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Monica from Friends. Sign your vote over to me. I don&amp;rsquo;t know shit
  about politics really, but I&amp;rsquo;m famous. Thank you for giving me political
  power along with fame and wealth you mindless drones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No child/wife of mine is going to vote while they live in my house.  Sign
  it over or get the fuck out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, we know many of you are there are used to voting straight
  Republican/Democrat. To continue this fine tradition would you please sign
  your vote over to the DNC/GOP?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi, this is the President speaking. This nation decided I was qualified
  enough to run the free world but COngress is causing me problems. If you
  support me please sign over your vote. In return I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure I&amp;rsquo;m elected
  again and Congress isn&amp;rsquo;t. Thank you for your support.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi, you may know me, I&amp;rsquo;m Bill Gates. I&amp;rsquo;m getting sick of government
  investigations. The next one million people to sign their vote over to me
  gets a free copy of Windows 2045. This time we fixed the bugs. No,
  seriously, we did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ultimately need not only secure, scalable deliberative processes
such as delegative democracy,
but secure and scalable &lt;em&gt;implementations&lt;/em&gt; of those processes
with strong, decentralized integrity and privacy protections.
As I alluded to above,
building the technical infrastructure needed
integrity-protected, privacy- and anonymity-preserving communication &amp;mdash;
in a decentralized model where
no single person, organization, or server needs to be blindly trusted
&amp;mdash;
has been one of the key goals of my group&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/&#34;&gt;Dissent project&lt;/a&gt;
for the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we now have all the key cryptographic tools and protocols
we need to create secure implementations of delegative democracy.
To oversimplify things just a bit,
what remains is SMOP, a &amp;ldquo;small matter of programming.&amp;rdquo;
I would be happy to work with any talented coder/activists
interested in collaborating to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faculty size and growth in the top 20 Computer Science departments</title>
      <link>http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the &lt;a href=&#34;http://yaledailynews.com&#34;&gt;Yale Daily News&lt;/a&gt; ran
&lt;a href=&#34;http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/21/cs-department-struggles-for-faculty/&#34;&gt;an article on our CS department&amp;rsquo;s faculty shortage&lt;/a&gt;,
which generated
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/randy.katz/posts/10103594916315693&#34;&gt;some discussion among CS colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.
Yale&amp;rsquo;s CS faculty shortage is not really news:
for example,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/01/29/computer-science-dept-overworked-understaffed/&#34;&gt;another YDN article over a year ago&lt;/a&gt;
made basically the same point,
and that probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside Yale in particular, however,
it is interesting to notice some broader trends in CS department growth.
So here are a couple charts I recently put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first estimates the number of tenure-track faculty
in each of the top 20 CS departments, ordered accoring to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings&#34;&gt;US News&amp;rsquo;s current rankings&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Major caveat&lt;/em&gt;:
this faculty size data is completely unofficial and approximate,
based purely on the number of apparent ladder faculty members listed
on the respective CS department web sites.
Obvious potential sources of error include, for example,
faculty positions that are split across departments
but not clearly labeled as &amp;ldquo;adjunct&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;courtesy&amp;rdquo; appointments,
and combined CS-and-EE departments in which it is not always obvious
which faculty are more &amp;ldquo;CS&amp;rdquo; and which are more &amp;ldquo;EE&amp;rdquo;.
But these represent best guesses based on publicly available information
and are reasonably accurate to the best of my knowledge.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://cra.org/&#34;&gt;CRA&lt;/a&gt; folks who put together the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cra.org/resources/taulbee/&#34;&gt;Taulbee Survey&lt;/a&gt;
probably have better and more &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; data,
but I don&amp;rsquo;t have that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth-charts/size-chart.svg&#34; style=&#34;width:40em&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the orange line indicates across the left half of the chart indicates,
CS departments in the top 10 appear to average about 67 ladder faculty,
with Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Georgia Tech being by far the largest,
and Princeton being the smallest of the top-10 at around 35 faculty.
As the yellow line on the right side indicates,
departments in the &amp;ldquo;next 10&amp;rdquo; category
appear to average around 39 ladder faculty each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is likely to be much of a surprise
to anyone familiar with CS academia.
What is more interesting is to look at the relative faculty growth
over the past decade, broken down the same way below.
The baseline numbers are derived from
the corresponding CS department home pages
as captured by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/index.php&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;
around September 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth-charts/growth-chart.svg&#34; style=&#34;width:40em&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average growth of the CS departments currently in the top 10
is a relatively modest 8% since 2004.
My sense is that most if not all of these top-10 departments
have been hiring aggressively and more-or-less continuously
over the past decade, but mainly just filling the vacancies regularly created
as faculty get sucked away to industry positions or startups.
But these departments haven&amp;rsquo;t needed to grow &amp;ldquo;much&amp;rdquo; because, hey,
they&amp;rsquo;re already on top of the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the picture for the &amp;ldquo;next 10&amp;rdquo; category looks interestingly different,
in which faculty size growth over the past decade
appears to have been around 21% on average.
Unless I&amp;rsquo;m mistaken,
USC in particular has nearly doubled in size over this period,
and a majority of departments in this category grew at least 20%.
Might we say these are the departments &amp;ldquo;bucking for the top 10&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all just for what it&amp;rsquo;s worth; no warranties yadda yadda.
Comments or corrections of any inaccuracies are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
