<p>XXX intro</p>

<p>summary of selfish mining</p>

<p>selfish mining as a transparency problem:
you get to build on a blockchain head you haven&rsquo;t published.</p>

<p>same as transparency problem in Apple FBI case for example;
that&rsquo;s what CoSi is for.</p>

<p>solution: any keyblock you build on is collectively signed,
and the next block&rsquo;s hash covers the last block&rsquo;s signature.</p>

<p>if you withhold a block, you can&rsquo;t get a collective signature on it;
without that collective signature,
you can&rsquo;t secretly mine a next block on top of it.</p>

<h2 id="selfish-mining">Selfish Mining</h2>

<p>Finally, we consider the now much more well-understood problem of
<a href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/">selfish mining</a>.
A selfish miner strategically withholds some of its successfully mined blocks
in attempt to gain a higher share of mining rewards,
by causing other miners to waste effort mining redundant blocks.
For example, if Greedy Greg successfully mines a new block,
he might deliberately delay announcing it.
If Innocent Ivan announces a competing block,
Greg quickly races to announce and widely distribute his,
which may reliably overtake Ivan&rsquo;s if Greg is fast and well-connected.
Alternatively, if Greg manages to mine a <em>second</em> block in private
before a competing first block appears,
then Greg is in the enviable position of being able to &ldquo;trump&rdquo;
and eliminate that competing block once it does appear,
simply by revealing his longer private blockchain.</p>

<p>While ByzCoin&rsquo;s keyblock mining mechanism alone is still
vulnerable to selfish mining,
its microblock commitment process using Byzantine consensus
provides a clean, simple defense against selfish mining.
Any transaction microblock the consensus group commits
contains a cryptographic hash of the latest known keyblock at the time,
and any newly-mined keyblock must similarly contain
a cryptographic hash of a recently-committed microblock
(e.g., within a few microblocks from the head).
Whenever the consensus group commits a new microblock,
all honest members verify that the keyblock pointer in the new microblock
is consistent with those in all prior microblocks,
ensuring that any new keyblock is &ldquo;locked in&rdquo;
irreversably once the new keyblock is known.
This leaves only seconds, rather than minutes,
in which a selfish miner could
try to announce and distribute a competing keyblock.
Further, because each keyblock must reference a recent microblock,
any newly-mined keyblock becomes invalid and useless
if its owner fails to announce it
within a few microblock commitment cycles &mdash;
again, on the order of seconds rather than minutes.</p>

<p>In essence, ByzCoin&rsquo;s microblock commit mechanism
enforces transparency on the keyblock mining process,
ensuring that a selfish ByzCoin miner would likely be faced with
a vanishingly small probability of profiting from
any keyblock-withholding strategy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post of course represents only an informal,
and no doubt incomplete, analysis
of the differences in incentives between Bitcoin and ByzCoin,
focusing primarily on mining incentives.
It is quite possible that a full, rigorous incentive analysis of ByzCoin
may reveal new incentive-compatibility issues that its architecture introduces.
Further, ByzCoin is still an experimental protocol
under rapid development and evoluation.</p>

<p>Given these caveats, however,
ByzCoin&rsquo;s architecture at least appears to be much more resilient
to the known strategic mining attacks against Bitcoin,
whether through block withholding or deliberate forking.
In particular,
by replacing Bitcoin&rsquo;s instant-gratification, winner-take-all reward model
with a delayed-gratification, investment-dividend model,
ByzCoin ensures that the distribution of mining profits are fixed
long before any strategic miner might know about or be able to respond to
the appearance of a goose egg or other transaction fee variance.
By ensuring that keyblocks and microblocks track each other cryptographically,
ByzCoin forces miners either to announce new keyblocks quickly
or else lose them,
making selfish mining unprofitable.</p>

<p>In short, it does not appear necessary for new cryptocurrencies to
&ldquo;<a href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/2016/10/21/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-reward/">make the block reward permanent and accept monetary inflation
as inevitable</a>&rdquo;
as Narayanan suggests.
Whether inflationary or deflationary monetary policies are preferable
is an important and highly debatable question,
but it need not be constrained by technical weaknesses of Bitcoin.
With more sophisticated blockchain architectures such as ByzCoin,
there is plenty of hope that mining incentives can work
independent of monetary policy.</p>
