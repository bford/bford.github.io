<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

Delegative Voting (DV)
is an alternative method of electing candidates to offices,
which shares the most important advantages
of other systems commonly proposed for electoral reforms
while addressing some of their most important practical obstacles.
Unlike all other serious alternatives,
DV can be used as an almost zero-cost, "drop-in" replacement
for conventional plurality or "first past the post" voting systems.
Voters in DV mark their ballots exactly as they do in plurality elections,
by selecting one of a list of candidates,
and for this reason DV will feel entirely familiar
to those accustomed to plurality voting.
Furthermore, DV requires no new investment in voting equipment
or extensive re-training of vote-counting staff or volunteers.
DV eliminates the well-known "spoiler effect" of plurality voting, however,
and greatly increases the effective choice voters have
by allowing them to vote for the candidate closest to their own viewpoint
without wasting their vote
or helping to elect a candidate they strongly oppose.

<p>
DV is equally applicable to both single-winner elections
(e.g., for offices such as President or Governor),
and for choosing multiple-seat bodies
(e.g., Congress, Parliament, Board of Directors).
With an appropriate ballot design,
DV makes it feasible to lift the usual restrictions
on the number of candidates that may compete in a given election,
without overburdening either the voters or the electoral administration.
In this way,
DV can provide much more proportional representation in multiple-seat elections
than even existing "proportional" systems such as List-PR or STV,
and can eliminate all vulnerability to gerrymandering.

<p>
With the formal and practical barriers to broad-spectrum candidacy removed,
DV enables the evolution
of an entirely new and qualitatively different electoral culture.
In this alternative culture,
voters normally vote
for local candidates who they know and trust <i>personally</i>,
rather than distant candidates they know
only through reputation, costly mass-media campaigns, and televised debates.
DV encourages many candidates to cooperate
to build direct, permanent political and social relationships
with each other and with their individual supporters,
forming a <i>web of delegates</i>
in which the "losing" candidates in a particular election
serve ongoing advisory and support roles
for the candidates in office.
Though the vast majority of candidates
may never attain a particular office,
<i>all</i> candidates can achieve political influence
directly proportional to their level of public support.
