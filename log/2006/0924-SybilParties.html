<h3>The Human Recognition Problem</h3>

<p>
Today's online ecosphere
continually suffers from its inability 
to tell who is a genuine, unique human and who isn't.
Because open-access messaging systems
cannot isolate or authenticate the <i>human</i> source of messages
for the purpose of suppressing abuses,
spam has already relegated USENET to historical obscurity
[<a href="#Templeton01">Templeton01</a>],
threatens the usability of E-mail [<a href="#Wouters05">Wouters05</a>],
and is even
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=skype+spam">advancing on Skype</a>.
The automated "Turing tests"
many web sites employ
lock out visually impaired users
[<a href="#Chong03">Chong03</a>, <a href="#May05">May05</a>]
and are vulnerable to attack
using artificial intelligence <a href="#Chellapilla05">[Chellapilla05]</a>
or social engineering
[<a href="#Doctorow04">Doctorow04</a>].
Wikipedia progressively tightens its editing rules
to combat the rising tide of anonymous vandalism
[<a href="#Knight05">Knight05</a>, <a href="#Hafner06">Hafner06</a>,
	<a href="#Thompson06">Thompson06</a>].
Voting-based participatory systems
such as <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>
operate reliably only to the extent that
nobody cares about the results of votes enough
to bother opening many accounts and stuffing the ballot boxes.
Banning detected abusers by IP address
frequently prevents access by other legitimate users
on the same ISP [<a href="#Kalsey04">Kalsey04</a>],
and many attacks come from compromized zombie machines
not under the control of their owners [<a href="#Evers05">Evers05</a>].

<p>
More serious proposed solutions to these abuses
typically revolve around authenticating a user's identity in some way
before granting (full) access.
Most E-commerce sites already require users to identify themselves
by entering personal information and a credit card
or even a bank account number,
although a few support emerging anonymous payment services
such as <a href="http://www.paysafecard.com/">paysafecard</a>,
<a href="http://www.xrost.biz/">Xrost</a>,
or <a href="http://www.ukash.com/">Ukash</a>.
Single sign-on initiatives
such as <a href="https://accountservices.passport.net/ppnetworkhome.srf">
Microsoft Passport</a>,
the <a href="http://www.projectliberty.org/">Liberty Alliance</a>,
and <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>
try to centralize a user's personal information
at a single "identity provider",
which various online services contact to authenticate the user.
<i>Identification</i> is often more than we want or need, however:
anonymous communication and social participation
is widely viewed as a crucial tool to safeguard basic democratic values
such as privacy and freedom of speech
[<a href="#Teich99">Teich99</a>],
and the rights of minorites <a href="#Stein03">[Stein03]</a>.

<h3>The One Person, One Persona Principle</h3>

<p>
Often what we need is not to determine <i>who</i> an online user is,
but merely to ensure that each human participant
in a given online service or community
can have only one account or persona at once.
If online services could reliably enforce
a <i>one person, one persona</i> rule when appropriate
without having to obtain and verify personal information,
then online personas would no longer be disposable
and thus would provide a degree of accountability.
Online services could temporarily revoke the access rights of abusers,
such as E-mail spammers or Wikipedia vandals,
without affecting innocent users
or permitting the same abuser to reappear immediately under a different name.
Voting-based systems for peer review or online democratic deliberation
could protect voting anonymity while preventing ballot box stuffing.

<p>
The abuse of an online system
by creating many illegitimate virtual personas
is known as a <i>sybil attack</i>,
after a famous case of multiple personality disorder
[<a href="#Schreiber75">Schreiber75</a>],
and there is probably no purely technical way
to defend against such attacks [<a href="#Douceur02">Douceur02</a>].
While distinguishing one human from another may be difficult for computers,
however,
humans manage this task all the time when we meet in person.
A relatively informal and inexpensive
bit of organizational infrastructure
in the <i>offline</i> world
might provide exactly the foundation we need
for anonymous but accountable online participation,
allowing users to create multiple privacy-preserving online personas
while protecting online services against sybil attacks.

<h3>Party Time</h3>

<p>
Suppose that on some particular day of every year -
let's call it <i>Sybil Day</i> for the moment -
groups of people interested in having private but accountable online personas
gather somewhere in their nearby physical neighborhood
to throw a party.
Any group of people may organize a such <i>sybil party</i>,
provided the group follows certain procedures
standardized by some broader distributed network of sybil party organizers
and opens itself to oversight by organizers of other parties
to ensure that the required procedures are followed correctly.
Outside of this standardized framework,
each sybil party's organizers are free to run their party as they see fit -
e.g., as a festive social occasion
in which participants are invited to bring food and drinks to share
(hence the term "party"),
as a conference or workshop
in which to discuss online social issues and the like,
or as a purely functional affair minimizing cost and volunteer effort.

<p>
Regardless of form,
at the heart of each sybil party is a procedure
in which each participant
receives login information granting access to one, and only one,
anonymous <i>sybil account</i> on a designated web site
run by the party's organizers or an affiliated organization.
Sybil accounts store no personal information,
and no one needs to show identification
or meet any requirements regarding age, citizenship, home location,
or other personal characteristics,
in order to obtain an account.
A New Yorker visiting Paris on Sybil Day
can just show up at any sybil party in Paris to get his yearly account,
and shouldn't even need to know French.
The only requirement is to be alive
and able to show up and follow the required procedure.
As with elections in poor countries
that have no formal voter registration,
each participant is marked with indelible ink
in an obvious place on their body
as they are given their sybil account,
preventing them from obtaining several accounts on the same day
(e.g., at different parties in the same area).

<h3>Using Sybil Accounts to Create Online Personas</h3>

<p>
A sybil account is not affiliated with any particular online service,
but acts as a front-end 
through which users create or renew accounts
on participating online services.
A user might login to his sybil account
and enter <tt>wikipedia.org</tt>,
for example,
to create a personal Wikipedia account for himself
and automatically log him into it.
The sybil account server is responsible for
enforcing the <i>one person, one persona</i> rule:
if the user enters <tt>wikipedia.org</tt> again in his sybil account,
he simply finds himself in his existing Wikipedia account.
Since each person can obtain one new sybil account per year,
online services may expire accounts created this way after a year
to prevent users from gradually accumulating many accounts,
and may offer users a way to transition smoothly
from one year's account to the next,
but such policies are specific to the online service.

<p>
A sybil account holder
may create one personal account on each of
any number of distinct online services in this way.
To protect the user's privacy,
the sybil account server ensures that online service providers
cannot tell which two accounts on different services
correspond to the same sybil account,
and hence the same user,
unless the user explicitly gives them personal information
establishing such a link.
If user uses his sybil account
to create both a professional profile for himself
on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>
and a steamy personal profile
on <a href="http://www.adultfriendfinder.com/">AdultFriendFinder</a>,
for example,
no one can tell that the two profiles represent the same person
even if the two web sites collude or are hacked -
unless, of course, the user gives away the connection,
by posting the same photo in both profiles for example.
Even then, the user could deny the connection,
claiming that someone had simply downloaded his photo from LinkedIn
and used it to fabricate an embarrassing profile on AdultFriendFinder,
and there would be no way to prove the connection existed
short of compromising the sybil account server.
In effect, the sybil account server
expressly defends the user's right to exhibit
a controlled form of "multiple personality disorder"
across different services
in order to protect his privacy.

<p>
Sybil accounts need not replace existing account creation and login mechanisms,
but could serve as a "premium" mechanism
offering rewards to users who make the effort
to help organize or at least show up at a sybil party once a year.
E-mail authenticated via a sybil account
might be exempted from heuristic spam filters,
for example,
preventing the loss of legitimate E-mail due to false positives.
Wikipedia might still allow users to create traditional accounts,
but could exempt sybil account users
from IP address bans
or from waiting periods imposed
between account creation and editing.
(An abusive E-mail or Wikipedia user logged in via a sybil account
can still be banned by his sybil account's pseudonymous identity,
of course,
and will be unable to create a fresh sybil account
until the next Sybil Day.)
Online services that support peer review by voting
might require a sybil account in order to cast votes,
while allowing less sensitive forms of access
via a traditional account or no account.

<h3>Trust and Security</h3>

<p>
Unlike identity-based single sign-on schemes,
users need not trust their sybil account provider
with their personal information,
because they never had to provide any personal information
to obtain the account.
Users may need to trust the sybil party organizers
to protect their privacy in the account assignment process:
e.g., not to try to identify and keep tabs on who was assigned which account.
Users also must trust the party's designated account server
to protect the relationship between different online service accounts
the user obtains via the same sybil account.
Each sybil party's organizers may run their own server
or work with a support organization they consider trustworthy;
each user in turn has a free choice
of which sybil party in their area to attend,
and thus which group of organizers to trust.

<p>
Online service providers must similarly trust sybil party organizers
and their designated account servers
to enforce the one person, one persona principle.
Each service's administrators ultimately choose
which sybil account servers to trust,
but the network of sybil party organizers may also need to establish
a system of mutual oversight and operational peer review
to monitor each party's health and trustworthiness.
Initially, each sybil party
might simply stake its claim to legitimacy
on the public, online or offline reputations of its organizers.

<h3>Implementation Issues</h3>

There are of course many issues and details to work out
before implementing such a scheme,
whose solutions I leave for now as exercises for the reader
and topics for discussion.
Here are a few:
<ul>
<li>	Is there a safe way to give new users "first-time" sybil accounts
	immediately when they learn about the system,
	without forcing them to wait up to nearly a year
	until the next Sybil Day?
<li>	Should there be "backup" mechanisms to obtain sybil accounts
	in case a person is sick or otherwise immobile on Sybil Day,
	or is at a location where there is not yet any organized sybil party?
<li>	Might sybil parties be allowed to give users the choice of showing ID
	and attaching personal information to their sybil account,
	so that they could use the same account
	for both anonymous and identity-based single sign-on if they wish to?
<li>	What specific software
	do sybil account servers and participating online services need,
	and what is the protocol by which they interact?
	Could existing identity-based single sign-on infrastructure
	be reused and adapted to this purpose?
<li>	To what extent, if any,
	should sybil parties and affiliated organizations
	be allowed or encouraged
	to build ties or accept the support of governments or corporations?
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Combating the sybil attacks
at the heart of many online problems
such as spam, wiki vandalism, and online ballot box stuffing,
need not and should not force us to give up our privacy.
Sybil parties would protect users' ability to maintain
multiple disconnected, potentially anonymous online personas,
while ensuring accountability
and allowing online services to enforce
the democratic "one person, one vote" principle when appropriate.
Sybil parties could in this way lead to
a more healthy, "sybilized" Internet.
