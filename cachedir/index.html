      <h1>Cache Directory Tagging Specification</h1>

      
<h2> Version 0.6 (<a href="#changes">Changes</a>)</h2>
<h3> Proposed by <a href="/">Bryan Ford</a> </h3>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
Many applications create and manage directories
containing cached information about content stored elsewhere,
such as cached Web content
or thumbnail-size versions of images or movies.
For speed and storage efficiency
we would often like to avoid backing up, archiving,
or otherwise unnecessarily copying such directories around,
but it is a pain to identify and individually exclude each such directory
during data transfer operations.
I propose an extremely simple convention
by which applications can reliably "tag" any cache directories they create,
for easy identification by backup systems and other data management utilities.
Data management utilities can then heed or ignore these tags
as the user sees fit.

<h2> The Problem </h2>

<p>
Many application programs create and manage <i>cache directories</i>
of some kind:
directories in which they store temporary information
whose storage can benefit the application's performance,
but which can easily be regenerated from other "primary" data sources
if it is lost.
For example,
most web browsers have a cache directory
in which they store downloaded Internet content
(<a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>
typically uses a directory called <code>Cache</code>
somewhere under <code>$(HOME)/.mozilla</code>).
When backing up, synchronizing, or transferring a user's home directory
from one machine to another,
we would usually like to avoid saving or transferring cache directories at all,
because:

<ul>
<li> The contents of a cache directory
	generally has no long-term archival value,
	since it just mirrors source material stored elsewhere
	and often in a reduced or incomplete form -
	e.g., only the parts of a web page that the user has visited recently,
	or thumbnail-sized versions of pictures the user has browsed.
<li> Cache directories can grow to a fairly substantial size -
	especially cache directories for web browsers -
	potentially wasting considerable backup storage space
	and/or network bandwidth.
<li> The contents of a cache directory tends to change frequently
	even when the user is merely browsing or viewing files,
	which confuses incremental backup or synchronization software
	into seeing many frequent "false changes" in the directory tree
	and defeating the efficiency of the incremental algorithm.
<li> The files in a cache directory
	are often named very cryptically
	(e.g., based on a hash of the name or content
	of the original source material).
	Seeing thousands of such meaningless filenames scroll past
	during operations that traverse a user's home directory
	is annoying at best,
	and may confuse or frighten inexperienced users.
</ul>

<p>
There are a great many applications that use cache directories,
however.
While some evolving standards attempt to standardize the locations of such directories,
most applications create their own cache directories in unpredictable locations
and manage them independently of other applications.
It therefore becomes very tedious,
even for experienced users who can easily recognize cache directories,
to figure out and list all of the appropriate <code>--exclude</code> options
for backups or other directory traversal operations.
Some applications,
such as recent versions of <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a>,
keep their cache directories in <code>/tmp</code> or <code>/var/tmp</code>,
which at least partly solves this problem
by getting the cached content out of the user's home directory entirely.
But there are good reasons an application or user
might not want these caches in <code>/tmp</code> or <code>/var/tmp</code>:
for example,
those directories may be on a different partition with limited space,
or files in them may be cleared out by the system too frequently
(e.g., after a day, or on every reboot)
to allow the cache to serve its intended purpose effectively.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>
specifies a system-wide <code>/var/cache</code> directory
intended to hold such cached information,
but this directory is not generally world-writable,
and thus can only be used by applications
pre-packaged with the system or installed by the system administrator.
The <a href="http://freedesktop.org/Standards/basedir-spec">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>
instead recommends that applications create their caches
in a location specified by a user environment variable,
or in a standard subdirectory of the user's home directory if that environment variable doesn't exist.
The XDG convention allows applications to operate without special permissions,
but it does not help systemwide backup or data management utilities
locate individual users' cache directories reliably,
because each user might set the environment variable differently in his or her login profile.

<h2> Proposed Solution </h2>

<p>
Given the present non-existence of any perfect agreement
on <i>where</i> applications should store their cached information,
I propose a very simple convention
that will at least allow such information to be <i>identified</i> effectively.
Regardless of where the application decides to (or is configured to)
place its cache directory,
it should place within this directory a file named:

<blockquote><pre>CACHEDIR.TAG</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This file <i>must</i> be an ordinary file,
not for example a symbolic link.
Additionally, the <i>first 43 octets</i> of this file
<i>must</i> consist of the following ASCII header string:

<blockquote><pre>Signature: 8a477f597d28d172789f06886806bc55</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Case is important in the header signature,
there can be no whitespace or other characters in the file
before the 'S',
and there is exactly one space character
(ASCII code 32 decimal)
after the colon.
The header string does not have to be followed by an LF or CR/LF in the file
in order for the file to be recognized as a valid cache directory tag.
The hex value in the signature
happens to be the MD5 hash of the string "<code>.IsCacheDirectory</code>".
This signature header is required
to avoid the chance of an unrelated file named <code>CACHEDIR.TAG</code>
being mistakenly interpreted as a cache directory tag
by data management utilities,
and (for example) causing valuable data not to be backed up.

<p>
The content of the remainder of the tag file is currently unspecified,
except that it should be a plain text file in UTF-8 encoding,
and any line beginning with a hash character ('<code>#</code>')
should be treated as a comment
and ignored by any software that reads the file.

<p>
We will henceforth refer to a file named as specified above,
and having the required signature at the beginning of its content,
as a <i>cache directory tag</i>.

<p>
For the benefit of anyone who
happens to find and look at a cache directory tag directly,
it is recommended that applications include in the file
a comment referring back to this specification.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Signature: 8a477f597d28d172789f06886806bc55
# This file is a cache directory tag created by <i>(application name)</i>.
# For information about cache directory tags, see:
#	http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The official "home" URL of this specification may change from the above
at some point if/when this proposal becomes more of a formal standard,
but in that case
an appropriate forwarding link will be left in the old location.

<h2> Application Semantics </h2>

<p>
The presence of a cache directory tag within a given directory
indicates that the <i>entire</i> contents of that directory,
including any and all subdirectories underneath it,
consists of cached information that can be re-generated if necessary
from appropriate source material located elsewhere.
An application that creates and/or uses a cache directory
should write a single cache directory tag
into the topmost directory whose contents represent cached information.
For example, if Mozilla creates a directory named
<code>$(HOME)/.mozilla/default/dg8t1ih0.slt/Cache</code>
to hold cached content downloaded from the Internet,
it would then create within it a cache directory tag named:
<code>$(HOME)/.mozilla/default/dg8t1ih0.slt/Cache/CACHEDIR.TAG</code>.
Only one cache directory tag is required
to tag an entire subdirectory tree of cached content.
The application should also regenerate the cache directory tag
if it disappears:
e.g., if the entire contents of the cache directory is deleted
without the directory itself being deleted.

<p>
Data backup, transfer, or synchronization software,
if configured to do so,
may interpret the presence of a cache directory tag in a directory
as a command to exclude that directory automatically
(including any subdirectories)
from the backup or transfer operation.
I leave it to the designers of such applications
to decide whether this "auto-exclude" behavior should be the default
or only adopted when specifically requested by the user.
A bit of conservatism is probably warranted in the short term,
but automatically excluding cache directories by default
could improve efficiency and ease-of-use in the longer term.

<p>
For maximum robustness against accidental data loss,
any tool that has built-in support for cache directory tags
is <i>strongly encouraged</i> to verify
that any file it finds named <code>CACHEDIR.TAG</code>
is a regular file
and actually contains the 43-byte header specified above,
before concluding that the file is indeed a cache directory tag.

<p>
User-friendly file managers and other directory hierarchy browsing software
may also want to notice the presence of a cache directory tag in a directory,
and inform the user that the contents of the directory is automatically managed
and is not likely to make much sense if "browsed" directly.

<p>
System administration software such as <code>du</code>
might provide a way to locate, total, and report the space usage
of all the cache directories on a partition,
helping the administrator to determine how much "soft" space
is in use on a file system
that could be easily freed up if necessary.
Similarly, a utility might allow the administrator
to clean out all the cache directories on the system,
or to delete files in cache directories beyond a certain "age."

<p>
System software <i>should not</i>, however,
just periodically go through and unilaterally
delete "old" files in arbitrary cache directories
on a purely automatic basis.
Different applications need to be able to manage their caches differently;
cached data that is considered "old" to one application or to the system
might not be considered "old" to another
(e.g., if certain data takes a long time to regenerate).
In the future this standard might be extended
to allow applications to write additional meta-data
in their cache directory tags,
providing system utilities with the additional information they would need
to manage application caches intelligently on a global basis.
For now, however,
the primary purpose for introducing cache directory tags
is merely to make it easy to avoid backing up or copying cached data
unnecessarily from one machine to another.

<h2> Security Considerations </h2>

"Blind" use of cache directory tags in automatic system backups
could potentially increase the damage
that intruders or malware could cause to a system.
A user or system administrator might be substantially less likely to notice 
the malicious insertion of a <tt>CACHDIR.TAG</tt> into an important directory
than the outright deletion of that directory,
for example,
causing the contents of that directory to be omitted from regular backups.
To mitigate this risk,
backup software should at least inform the user which directories
are being omitted due to the presence of cache directory tags.
Automatic incremental backup software might
maintain a list of "approved" cache directories,
and whenever new cache directory tags appear,
only heed them after being approved by the system administrator.
In short,
to maintain robustness of backups in the face of security compromises,
cache directory tags should only be treated as hints,
never as "the final word" on what should and should not be backed up.

<h2> Alternative Approaches </h2>

This section discusses a few of the alternatives that were considered in developing this proposal,
and the rationale for designing the proposal as specified.
It is formatted as a mini-FAQ addressing the most common questions.

<ul>
<li>	<p><b>Why not just standardize the location where applications keep their cache directories?</b>
	First, there are already multiple conflicting standards:
	e.g., the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>
	specifies <code>/var/cache</code>,
	<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> currently uses <code>/var/tmp</code>,
	and the <a href="http://freedesktop.org/Standards/basedir-spec">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>
	specifies the use of a user-customizable environment variable,
	falling back on <code>$(HOME)/.cache</code> in the user's home directory.
	Even if one such standard eventually "wins",
	there is inevitable tension between standardizing the placement of application caches
	and allowing users to customize it.
	The XDG specification clearly recognizes this tension and accounts for it,
	but its very flexibility makes it difficult or impossible for systemwide utilities
	to locate each user's cache directory reliably,
	even if all applications were to conform to the XDG standard.

<li>	<p><b>Why not just use the existing "no-backup" or "no-dump" extended file attributes
	that some operating systems support?</b>
	Because only some operating systems
	(and generally only certain specific file systems in them)
	support those attributes.
	Any proposed convention for tagging cache directories that depends on non-portable OS features
	would inherently have limited applicability
	and would not likely be widely adopted among portable applications.
	Applications are free
	to support system-specific extensions when available,
	but for maximum usefulness
	we really need one extremely simple, portable convention
	that caching applications can adopt with almost no effort,
	and that is the purpose of this proposal.

<li>	<p><b>Why shouldn't all web browsers just use the same cache?</b>
	Sharing a single Internet content cache among multiple web browsers or other web applications,
	all of which might be running concurrently,
	is a very useful and important goal -
	but it presents considerable technical challenges that are still being worked out.
	Even when such sharing is achieved for web content caches, however,
	many other applications maintain other types of on-disk caches
	in which they store entirely different kinds of data,
	such as intermediate results for long-running computations
	or swap space for large data sets.
	It is unreasonable to expect applications to share caches
	when those caches serve entirely different purposes
	and inherently must be managed differently.
	But it would still be useful, and it is much more realistic,
	to expect applications at least to make their caches easily <i>identifiable</i> as such
	by adopting a simple convention such as the one proposed here.

<li>	<p><b>Why does the proposal only support cache <i>directories</i> -
	what if an application only has a single file that it uses as a cache?</b>
	Because the tagging scheme is much simpler and easier to take advantage of this way,
	and imposes no great burden on caching applications.
	If you're not paranoid about checking cache directory tag file headers,
	then most existing, unmodified backup/archive applications
	can immediately take advantage of this tagging convention
	via some pretty trivial shell-fu.
	For example:

	<pre>
	find . -name CACHEDIR.TAG | sed -e 's/[/]CACHEDIR.TAG$//g' >/tmp/excludes
	tar cvf /tmp/backup.tar --exclude-from=/tmp/excludes .
	</pre>

	Trying to support the tagging of individual files within a directory
	would probably mean at least having to parse text files and scan them for file names,
	making the convention much more complex and potentially delicate at the outset.
	And when it comes to standards that affect what data gets backed up and what doesn't,
	we obviously would like them to be as simple and robust as possible.

	<p>
	For those existing caching applications that keep all their cached data in a single file,
	it should not be inordinately difficult for them
	just to move that cache file down one level into its own separate subdirectory,
	and write a cache directory tag into that new subdirectory alongside the cache file.
	Such a slight directory structure change should not cause any backward compatibility problems,
	since by definition any cache file in the old location is regenerable and can just be deleted or moved.
	And users won't care because they aren't normally expected to see directly or understand
	the application's cache files or directories anyway.
</ul>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

By adopting the convention described above
of writing cache directory tags where appropriate,
applications that create and manage cache directories
will make it much easier for users and system administrators
to identify and manage "soft" storage areas
whose contents are useful for performance
but do not need to be backed up or synchronized across machines.
This proposal deliberately attempts to adopt the simplest reasonable and portable solution,
in the interest of maximizing robustness while minimizing cost of adoption,
and hence hopefully maximizing its chance of eventual widespread adoption.
The proposal nevertheless leaves room for future enhancements,
in which applications might include within their cache directory tags
additional useful information about the semantics and management of their cache directories.
