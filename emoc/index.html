<h3>
What is an "emocracy"?</h3>
To a first order, an emocracy is exactly what the term was coined to suggest:
an "electronic democracy."&nbsp; More specifically, an emocracy is an organization
built around the general democratic goals of fairness and bottom-up control
by the membership, but which takes maximum advantage of the power of modern
technology in order to achieve these goals more effectively.&nbsp; An emocracy
does not just use technology to do conventional things more efficiently
- such as by using E-mail or streaming audio/video as means of communication
between members or by using computers to count votes - but uses technology
to enable <i>fundamental new and more effective methods of organization</i>.
<h3>
The Emocracies Project</h3>
This web page is intended to be the seed of a project to explore all the
ways in which technology is being or could be used to make democratic organizations
function better, and to brainstorm and develop new technologies (e.g.,
open-source software) specifically for this purpose.&nbsp; Initially, it
is a personal research project by Bryan Ford, the author of this page;
however, I&nbsp;hope that over time other people will become interested
and that the project will gradually evolve into a collective effort and
become an emocracy in its own right.
<h3>
Ideas</h3>
In this section I&nbsp;sketch some brief, "food for thought" ideas, with
the purpose of inviting critique and further discussion.&nbsp; As this
project expands and matures this material will be continually revised,
rewritten, and reorganized.
