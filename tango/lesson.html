<h1>A Private Lesson</h1>
</center>


There's real tango and fake tango.
Fake tango is only for show...
The players hold each other apart
the better to display their perfectly-toned bodies
and the back-breaking physical contortions of which they are capable;
they thrash their heads about with glazed smiles
in a lifeless attempt to mimic the ecstasy
that their aerobic muscle routines fail to give them.

...cheap, titillating videos to take home...


The embrace...
Let your hair fall over my right arm,
wrapped all the way around your back and right side...
Rest your left arm gently on my right,
with your hand on the muscles behind my shoulder...


Real tango requires trust.
Come to me, push yourself in toward me,
trust that I'll take care of you and won't let you fall.
No, not like that:
don't just bend forward at the waist
as if to give me a casual European cheek-peck,
while withholding your body...
There's no trust there.
You must give me not just the tentative touch of your arms
but the full soft pressure of your chest and hips,
knees gently arced forward over your toes,
letting me know with the weight of your body
that would fall if I wasn't there and trust me to stay.

Move with me...
When I thrust myself into your space, yield;
when I relax and fall backward,
push yourself toward me so that we keep our connection.
Whereever I am is where you want to be.

The music...
Most dance music has a steady, automatic rhythm like a heartbeat...
Tango music is made of deliberate pulses
in irregular arrangements:
slow, methodical beats
mixed with fast syncopations,
pauses followed by powerful, slow-building <i>whumps</i>.
Other music is for dancers running on auto-pilot;
tango is for dancers who can pay attention
to every melodic and rhythmic variation
and compose an improvised counterpoint theme
in real time with their bodies.


"!!?"
Don't be scared; I'm still with you.
That's a lean.
You must trust me even more:
relax, let the full length of your body, head to high heels,
melt into the curve of mine that I present you.
If you can do that,
then every unexpected lean will make you feel like you're flying,
like when your father would toss and spin you as a three-year-old.
