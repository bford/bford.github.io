<p align="center"><strong>FEBRUARY 12, 1998</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong></p>



<p>	Mr. Chairman, I am John Maresca, Vice President, International Relations,
of Unocal Corporation.  Unocal is one of the world's leading energy resource
and project development companies.  Our activities are focused on three major
regions -- Asia, Latin America and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  In Asia and
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we are a major <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
and gas producer.  I appreciate your invitation to speak here today.  I believe
these hearings are important and timely, and I congratulate you for focusing
on Central Asia <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> and gas reserves and the role they play in shaping U.S. policy.</p>



<p>	Today we would like to focus on three issues concerning this region, its resources and U.S. policy:</p>



<p>The need for multiple <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> routes for Central Asian <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> and gas.</p>



<p>The need for U.S. support for international and regional efforts to achieve
balanced and lasting political settlements within Russia, other newly independent
states and in <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b>.</p>



<p>The need for structured assistance to encourage economic reforms and the 
 development of appropriate investment climates in the region.  In this regard,
we specifically support repeal or removal of Section 907 of the Freedom Support
Act.</p>



<p>For more than 2,000 years, Central Asia has been a meeting ground between
Europe and Asia, the site of ancient east-west trade routes collectively
called the Silk Road and, at various points in history, a cradle of scholarship,
culture and power.  It is also a region of truly enormous natural resources,
which are revitalizing cross-border trade, creating positive political interaction
and stimulating regional cooperation.  These resources have the potential
to recharge the economies of neighboring countries and put entire regions
on the road to prosperity.</p>



<p>	About 100 years ago, the international <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> industry was born in the Caspian/Central Asian region with the discovery of <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>.  In the intervening years, under Soviet rule, the existence</p>





<p>of the region's <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> and gas resources was generally known, but only partially or poorly developed.</p>



<p>	As we near the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, history brings us
full circle.  With political barriers falling, Central Asia and the Caspian
are once again attracting people from around the globe who are seeking ways
to develop and deliver its bountiful energy resources to the markets of the
world.</p>



<p>	The Caspian region contains tremendous untapped hydrocarbon reserves,
much of them located in the Caspian Sea basin itself.  Proven natural gas
reserves within Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan equal
more than 236 trillion cubic feet.  The region's total <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> reserves may reach more than 60 billion barrels of <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> -- enough to service Europe's <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
needs for 11 years.  Some estimates are as high as 200 billion barrels. 
In 1995, the region was producing only 870,000 barrels per day (44 million
tons per year [Mt/y]).</p>



<p>	By 2010, Western companies could increase production to about 4.5 million
barrels a day (Mb/d) -- an increase of more than 500 percent in only 15 years.
 If this occurs, the region would represent about five percent of the world's
total <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> production, and almost 20 percent of <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> produced among non-OPEC countries. </p>



<p>	One major problem has yet to be resolved:  how to get the region's vast
energy resources to the markets where they are needed.  There are few, if
any, other areas of the world where there can be such a dramatic increase
in the supply of <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
and gas to the world market.  The solution seems simple:  build a "new" Silk
Road.  Implementing this solution, however, is far from simple.  The risks
are high, but so are the rewards.</p>



<p><strong>Finding and Building Routes to World Markets</strong></p>



<p>	One of the main problems is that Central Asia is isolated.  The region
is bounded on the north by the Arctic Circle, on the east and west by vast
land distances, and on the south by a series of natural obstacles -- mountains
and seas -- as well as political obstacles, such as conflict zones or sanctioned
countries.</p>



<p>	This means that the area's natural resources are landlocked, both geographically
and politically.  Each of the countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia
faces difficult political challenges.  Some have unsettled wars or latent
conflicts.  Others have evolving systems where the laws -- and even the courts
-- are dynamic and changing.  Business commitments can be rescinded without
warning, or they can be displaced by new geopolitical realities.</p>



<p>	In addition, a chief technical obstacle we face in transporting <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> is the region's existing <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b>
infrastructure.  Because the region's pipelines were constructed during the
Moscow-centered Soviet period, they tend to head north and west toward Russia.
 There are no connections to the south and east.</p>



<p>	Depending wholly on this infrastructure to export Central Asia <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> is not practical.  Russia currently is unlikely to absorb large new quantities of "foreign" <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>, is unlikely to be a significant market for energy in the next decade, and lacks the capacity to deliver it to other markets.</p>



<p>	Certainly there is no easy way out of Central Asia.  If there are to be other routes, in other directions, they must be built.</p>



<p>	Two major energy infrastructure projects are seeking to meet this challenge.  One, under the aegis of the Caspian <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">Pipeline</b> Consortium, or CPC, plans to build a <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> west from the Northern Caspian to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossisk.  From Novorossisk, <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> from this line would be transported by tanker through the Bosphorus to the Mediterranean and world markets. </p>



<p>	The other project is sponsored by the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), a consortium of 11 foreign <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
companies including four American companies -- Unocal, Amoco, Exxon and Pennzoil.
 It will follow one or both of two routes west from Baku.  One line will
angle north and cross the North Caucasus to Novorossisk.  The other route
would cross Georgia and extend to a shipping terminal on the Black Sea port
of Supsa.  This second route may be extended west and south across Turkey
to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.</p>



<p>	But even if both pipelines were built, they would not have enough total capacity to transport all the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
expected to flow from the region in the future; nor would they have the capability
to move it to the right markets.  Other export pipelines must be built.</p>



<p>	Unocal believes that the central factor in planning these pipelines should
be the location of the future energy markets that are most likely to need
these new supplies.  Just as Central Asia was the meeting ground between
Europe and Asia in centuries past, it is again in a unique position to potentially
service markets in both of these regions -- if export routes to these markets
can be built.  Let's take a look at some of the potential markets.</p>



<p><strong>Western Europe</strong></p>



<p>	Western Europe is a tough market.  It is characterized by high prices for <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
products, an aging population, and increasing competition from natural gas.
 Between 1995 and 2010, we estimate that demand for <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
will increase from 14.1 Mb/d (705 Mt/y) to 15.0 Mb/d (750 Mt/y), an average
growth rate of only 0.5 percent annually.  Furthermore, the region is already
amply supplied from fields in the Middle East, North Sea, Scandinavia and
Russia.  Although there is perhaps room for some of Central Asia's <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>, the Western European market is unlikely to be able to absorb all of the production from the Caspian region. </p>



<p><strong>Central and Eastern Europe</strong></p>



<p>	Central and Eastern Europe markets do not look any better.  Although there is increased demand for <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> in the region's transport sector, natural gas is gaining strength as a competitor. Between 1995 and 2010, demand for <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
is expected to increase by only half a million barrels per day, from 1.3
Mb/d (67 Mt/y) to 1.8 Mb/d (91.5 Mt/y).  Like Western Europe, this market
is also very competitive.  In addition to supplies of <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> from the North Sea, Africa

and the Middle East,  Russia supplies the majority of the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> to this region.</p>



<p><strong>The Domestic NIS Market</strong></p>



<p>	The growth in demand for <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
also will be weak in the Newly Independent States (NIS). We expect Russian
and other NIS markets to increase demand by only 1.2 percent annually between
1997 and 2010.</p>



<p><strong>Asia/Pacific</strong></p>



<p>	In stark contrast to the other three markets, the Asia/Pacific region has a rapidly increasing demand for <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
and an expected significant increase in population.  Prior to the recent
turbulence in the various Asian/Pacific economies, we anticipated that this
region's demand for <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
would almost double by 2010.  Although the short-term increase in demand
will probably not meet these expectations, Unocal stands behind its long-term
estimates.</p>



<p>	Energy demand growth will remain strong for one key reason:  the region's
population is expected to grow by 700 million people by 2010.</p>



<p>	It is in everyone's interests that there be adequate supplies for Asia's
increasing energy requirements.  If Asia's energy needs are not satisfied,
they will simply put pressure on all world markets, driving prices upwards
everywhere. </p>



<p>	The key question is how the energy resources of Central Asia can be made
available to satisfy the energy needs of nearby Asian markets.  There are
two possible solutions -- with several variations. </p>



<p><strong><u>Export Routes</u></strong></p>



<p><strong>East to China:  Prohibitively Long?</strong></p>



<p>	One option is to go east across China.  But this would mean constructing a <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b>
of more than 3,000 kilometers to central China -- as well as a 2,000-kilometer
connection to reach the main population centers along the coast.  Even with
these formidable challenges, China National Petroleum Corporation is considering
building a <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> east from Kazakhstan to Chinese markets.</p>



<p>	Unocal had a team in Beijing just last week for consultations with the
Chinese.  Given China's long-range outlook and its ability to concentrate
resources to meet its own needs, China is almost certain to build such a
line.  The question is what will the costs of transporting <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> through this <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> be and what netback will the producers receive.</p>



<p><strong>South to the Indian Ocean:  A Shorter Distance to Growing Markets</strong></p>



<p>	A second option is to build a <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> south from Central Asia to the Indian Ocean.</p>



<p>	One obvious potential route south would be across Iran.  However, this
option is foreclosed for American companies because of U.S. sanctions legislation.
 The only other possible route option is across <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b>, which has its own unique challenges.</p>



<p>	The country has been involved in bitter warfare for almost two decades.  The territory across which the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b>
would extend is controlled by the Taliban, an Islamic movement that is not
recognized as a government by most other nations.  From the outset, we have
made it clear that construction of our proposed <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> cannot begin until a recognized government is in place that has the confidence of governments, lenders and our company.</p>



<p>	In spite of this, a route through <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b>
appears to be the best option with the fewest technical obstacles.  It is
the shortest route to the sea and has relatively favorable terrain for a
<b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b>.  The route through <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b> is the one that would bring Central Asian <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> closest to Asian markets and thus would be the cheapest in terms of transporting the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>.</p>



<p>	Unocal envisions the creation of a Central Asian <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">Oil </b><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">Pipeline</b> Consortium.  The <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> would become an integral part of a regional <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil </b><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> system that will utilize and gather <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> from existing <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> infrastructure in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia.</p>



<p>	The 1,040-mile-long <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil </b><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> would begin near the town of Chardzhou, in northern Turkmenistan, and extend southeasterly through <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b> to an export terminal that would be constructed on the Pakistan coast on the Arabian Sea.  Only about 440 miles of the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> would be in <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b>.</p>



<p>	This 42-inch-diameter <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> will have a shipping capacity of one million barrels of <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> per day.  Estimated cost of the project -- which is similar in scope to the Trans Alaska <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">Pipeline</b> -- is about US$2.5 billion.  </p>



<p>	There is considerable international and regional political interest in this <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b>.  Asian crude <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
importers, particularly from Japan, are looking to Central Asia and the Caspian
as a new strategic source of supply to satisfy their desire for resource
diversity.  The <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> benefits  Central Asian countries because it would allow them to sell their <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> in expanding and

highly prospective hard currency markets.  The <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> would benefit <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b>,
which would receive revenues from transport tariffs, and would promote stability
and encourage trade and economic development.  Although Unocal has not negotiated
with any one group, and does not favor any group, we have had contacts with
and briefings for all of them.  We know that the different factions in <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b> understand the importance of the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> project for their country, and have expressed their support of it.</p>



<p>	A recent study for the World Bank states that the proposed <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> from Central Asia across <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b> and Pakistan to the Arabian Sea would provide more favorable netbacks to <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
producers through access to higher value markets than those currently being
accessed through the traditional Baltic and Black Sea export routes.</p>



<p>	This is evidenced by the netback values producers will receive as determined
by the World Bank study.  For West Siberian crude, the netback value will
increase by nearly $2.00 per barrel by going south to Asia.  For a producer
in western Kazakhstan, the netback value will increase by more than $1 per
barrel by going south to Asia as compared to west to the Mediterranean via
the Black Sea.</p>



<p><strong>Natural Gas Export</strong></p>



<p>Given the plentiful natural gas supplies of Central Asia, our aim is to
link a specific natural resource with the nearest viable market.  This is
basic for the commercial viability of any gas project.  As with all projects
being considered in this region, the following projects face geo-political
challenges, as well as market issues.</p>



<p>	Unocal and the Turkish company, Koc Holding A.S., are interested in bringing
competitive gas supplies to the Turkey market.  The proposed Eurasia Natural
Gas <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">Pipeline</b>
would transport gas from Turkmenistan directly across the Caspian Sea through
Azerbaijan and Georgia to Turkey.  Sixty percent of this proposed gas <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> would follow the same route as the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil </b><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> proposed to run from Baku to Ceyhan.  Of course, the demarcation of the Caspian remains an issue.</p>



<p>	Last October, the Central Asia <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">Pipeline</b>, Ltd. (CentGas) consortium, in which Unocal holds an interest, was formed to develop a gas <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b>
that will link Turkmenistan's vast natural gas reserves in the Dauletabad
Field with markets in Pakistan and possibly India.  An independent evaluation
shows that the field's resources are adequate for the project's needs, assuming
production rates rising over time to 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day
for 30 years or more. </p>



<p>	In production since 1983, the Dauletabad Field's natural gas has been
delivered north via Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia to markets in the Caspian
and Black Sea areas.  The proposed 790-mile <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> will open up new markets for this gas, travelling from Turkmenistan through <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b> to Multan, Pakistan.  A proposed extension would link with the existing Sui <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> system, moving gas to near New Delhi, where it would connect with the existing HBJ <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b>.
 By serving these additional volumes, the extension would enhance  the economics
of the project, leading to overall reductions in delivered natural gas costs
for all users and better margins.  As currently planned, the CentGas <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">pipeline</b> would cost approximately $2 billion.  A 400-mile extension into India could add $600 million to the overall project cost.  </p>



<p>	As with the proposed Central Asia <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">Oil </b><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(153,255,153);">Pipeline</b>, CentGas cannot begin construction until an internationally recognized <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b>
government is in place.  For the project to advance, it must have international
financing, government-to-government agreements and government-to-consortium
agreements.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>	The Central Asia and Caspian region is blessed with abundant <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b> and gas that can enhance the lives of the region's residents and provide energy for growth for Europe and Asia.</p> 

<p>	The impact of these resources on U.S. commercial interests and U.S. foreign
policy is also significant and intertwined.  Without peaceful settlement
of conflicts within the region, cross-border <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160,255,255);">oil</b>
and gas pipelines are not likely to be built.  We urge the Administration
and the Congress to give strong support to the United Nations-led peace process
in <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255,255,102);">Afghanistan</b>.</p>



<p>	U.S. assistance in developing these new economies will be crucial to
business' success.  We encourage strong technical assistance programs throughout
the region.  We also urge repeal or removal of Section 907 of the Freedom
Support Act.  This section unfairly restricts U.S. government assistance
to the government of Azerbaijan and limits U.S. influence in the region.</p>



<p>	Developing cost-effective, profitable and efficient export routes for
Central Asia resources is a formidable, but not impossible, task.  It has
been accomplished before.  A commercial corridor, a "new" Silk Road, can
link the Central Asia supply with the demand -- once again making Central
Asia the crossroads between Europe and Asia.</p>



<p>	Thank you.</p>
