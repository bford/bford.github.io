<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p>
Distributed systems designers typically strive to improve performance and
preserve availability despite failures or attacks; but, when strong consistency
is also needed, they encounter fundamental limitations. The bottleneck is in
replica coordination, which is impacted by partitions and slowdowns that can
occur anywhere. We believe the present ecosystem fails to recognize that not
all failures and partitions are supposed to be equal — at least from a
user-centric performance and availability standpoint. Failures distant from a
user should intuitively be less likely to affect that user. Today’s ecosystem
fails this test, however, despite high-availability best practices. For
example, correlated and cascading failures, caused by misconfiguration, bugs,
and network partitions, often invalidate the cloud’s assumptions of failure
independence. Likewise, large-scale or accurately targeted routing or denial of
service attacks can slow or halt a distributed ledger or compromise its
security. 

<p>
We believe that distributed systems designers and practitioners can and should
build reliable, responsive systems by making Lamport exposure and asynchrony
central design considerations. We propose that distributed services need not
and should not expose local activities to distant failures or partitions, no
matter how severe. Limix is the first exposure-limiting metadata configuration
service that addresses this problem. Limix insulates global strongly-consistent
data-plane services and objects from remote failures and partitions by ensuring
that the definitive, strongly-consistent metadata for every object is always
confined to the same zone as the object itself. Nyle is a trust-but-verify
distributed ledger architecture that limits transaction exposure. While
employing similar design principles as Limix, Nyle additionally supports an
environment with Byzantine nodes and potentially compromised regions with an
elevated presence of attackers, and enables asymmetric user trust preferences.
Both Limix and Nyle outperform related work in terms of availability, at a
manageable overhead. We also demonstrate, through the design of QSC, that
consensus protocols can deal with network asynchrony without relying on common
coins, having the potential to make consensus more responsive and more
practical.
