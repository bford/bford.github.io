<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p> Third-party applications such as Quora or StackOverflow allow users to log
in through a federated identity provider such as Facebook (Log in with
Facebook), Google+ or Twitter. This process is called federated authentication.
Examples of federated identity providers include social networks as well as
other non-social network identity providers such as PayPal.

<p> Federated identity providers have gained widespread popularity among users
as a way to manage their online identity across the web. While protocols like
OAuth and OpenID allow users to maintain a single set of credentials for
federated authentication, such federated login can leak privacy-sensitive
profile information, making the user’s online activity more easily tracked.

<p> To protect themselves, users could forego using such identities altogether,
or limit the content of their profiles. Ideally, users could leverage their
federated identities but in a way as to prevent third party applications from
accessing sensitive information. While anonymous authentication techniques have
been proposed, their practicality depend on such technologies as PGP or complex
encryption algorithms which most users lack the knowledge or motivation to use
effectively.

<p> While federated identity providers offer a convenient and increasingly
popular mechanism for federated authentication, unfortunately, they also
exacerbate many privacy and tracking risks. We present Crypto-Book, a privacy
preserving layer enabling federated authentication while reducing these risks.

<p> Crypto-Book relies on a set of independently managed servers that
collectively assign each federated identity credentials (either a
public/private keypair or blinded signed messages). We propose two components,
”credential producers” that create and issue clients with privacy preserving
credentials, and ”credendial consumers” that verify these privacy preserving
credentials for authentication of clients to third party applications.

<p> The credential producer servers have split trust and use a (t,n)-threshold
cryptosystem to collaboratively generate client credentials. Using their
credentials, clients can then leverage anonymous authentication techniques such
as linkable ring signatures or blind signatures to log into third party
applications via credential consumers, while preserving privacy.

<p> We have implemented our system and demonstrate its use with four distinct
applications: a Wiki system, an anonymous group communication system, a whistle
blower submission system based on SecureDrop, and a privacy preserving chat
room system. Our results show that for anonymity sets of size 100 and 2048-bit
DSA keys, Crypto-Book ring signature authentication takes 1.641s for signature
generation by the client, 1.632s for signature verification on the server, and
requires 8.761KB of communication bandwidth. Similarly for partially blind
signature authentication, each phase takes under 0.05s and requires 0.325KB of
bandwidth.

<p> Crypto-Book is practical and has low overhead: We deployed a privacy
preserving chat room system built on top of the Crypto-Book architecture.
Within the deployment within our research group, Crypto-Book group
authentication took 1.607s end- to-end, an overhead of 1.2s compared to
traditional non privacy preserving federated authentication.
