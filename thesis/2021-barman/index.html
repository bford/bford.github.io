<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p> Most communication systems (e.g., e-mails, instant messengers, VPNs) use
encryption to prevent third parties from learning sensitive information.
However, encrypted communications protect the contents but often leak metadata:
the amount of data sent and the time it was sent, the way the data should be
decrypted, the identity of the sender and the recipient. These metadata are a
pervasive threat to privacy: They enable a variety of attacks that range from
recovering plaintext contents from encrypted communications to inferring
communicating parties.

<p> Our goal in this thesis is two-fold: First, to raise awareness about this
problem by demonstrating attacks that threaten user privacy; and second, to
propose novel solutions that reduce the metadata leakage and maintain
acceptable usability and costs.

<p> To achieve the first goal, we present the first work that performs an
in-depth analysis of the communications of wearable devices under the lens of
traffic analysis. We demonstrate that the metadata of Bluetooth communications
of wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers, and blood-pressure
monitors) leak sensitive information to a passive observer, despite the use of
encryption. By design, these devices handle fine-grained and long-term,
personal, medical and lifestyle-related data from their users. We show that
typical defense strategies are ineffective: they only moderately hamper the
adversary’s task and have a high overhead. Our work highlights the need to
rethink how sensitive data is exchanged in this setting. More generally, we
confirm that metadata can pose a threat to user privacy, even in settings where
traffic-analysis attacks are perhaps not an immediate threat.

<p> For the second goal, we begin by presenting a theoretical contribution that
concerns ciphertext formats: Padmé, a padding function designed to reduce the
metadata leakage of files and messages through their length. Padmé efficiently
hides the size of objects, even when they have very different sizes. Padmé is a
part of PURBs, a ciphertext format that does not leak metadata, except for a
small amount about the size.

<p> Then, we design systems that enable communicating while reducing metadata
leakage: Anonymous Communication Networks (ACNs). ACNs protect against some
metadata leakage (e.g., who is communicating and when). Traffic-analysis
resistant ACNs have not seen widespread adoption yet, possibly due to their
technical shortcomings. We focus on two particular aspects that remain unsolved
by the related work: small-scale traffic-agnostic communication that achieves
low latency, and large-scale asynchronous messaging that handles millions of
users.

<p> We present PriFi, an ACN that provides provable traffic-analysis resistance
and low-latency in the context of a local-area network. The protocol hides the
source of a message by ensuring that the communication patterns of all
participants are equal, even in the presence of active attacks. PriFi has a
high bandwidth cost but ensures low-latency and traffic-agnostic communication
for a small set of users.

<p> We then present Rubato, an ACN for anonymous messaging that handles
millions of users. Other large-scale ACNs have an important limitation: A
sender and a recipient need to be online at the same time to resist
intersection attacks. As participants are uncoordinated, they need to be online
and to send cover traffic at all times, which is infeasible for many users. We
present Rubato, a circuit-based mixnet that enables its users to be
asynchronous; they can participate in the network according to their own
schedule. Unlike all previous ACNs, this enables users to participate using
their mobile devices.
