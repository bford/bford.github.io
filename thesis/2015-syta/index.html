<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p> Maintaining privacy on the Internet is increasingly difficult in this
ever-connected world. In most cases, our online interactions are a highly
personalized experience and require some form of identity verification, most
commonly, logging into an account. Unfortunately, people frequently give away
a lot of information while obtaining accounts, reuse usernames and passwords
across different services, or link their accounts to take advantage of single
sign-on to avoid retyping passwords. This approach seriously blurs the line
between different aspects of one’s digital life, specifically personal and
professional, as services dedicated for personal use (e.g., Facebook, bank
accounts) and professional use (e.g. LinkedIn, corporate email account) become
intertwined.

<p> Identity management, the process of making decisions about online
identities or accounts, is inherently linked to authentication, the process of
creating and using online identities. However, the link between these two
critical concepts is not always clear because of the lack of understanding of
these terms as well as proper terminology to describe them. Identity management
is further hindered by the lack of privacy-preserving authentication solutions
that target specific applications and result in identities appropriate for
those applications. Depending on the application, effective solutions to manage
identities can be very diverse with unique or unexpected properties. In certain
cases allowing users to hide their identity is as valuable as providing
unforgeable identities. Nonetheless, currently deployed authentication
protocols do not reflect this approach.

<p> In response, we make the following contributions. We carefully analyze the
relationships between authentication, privacy and identity management and
discover subtle yet important distinctions between the related concepts. As a
result, we propose new terminology in order to clarify and draw distinctions
between these critical concepts. We identify two distinct cases of
authentication and propose privacy-preserving protocols to implement them. The
protocols, PrivateEyes and DAGA, target different applications and produce
identities that balance the requirements of their intended applications as well
as their clients’ privacy and security needs.

<p> PrivateEyes is an efficient remote biometric identification protocol. It
uses unique biometric characteristics in a privacy-preserving fashion for
client verification, producing an identity that is suitable for applications
requiring a high level of assurance of the client’s real-world identity.

<p> DAGA is a deniable anonymous authentication protocol. It offers four
properties that give clients strong security and privacy protection, making
it suitable for applications such as whistleblowing or access to sensitive
resources. The properties are anonymity, proportionality, deniability, and
forward anonymity. Anonymity and proportionality allow a client to authenticate
as some group member without revealing exactly which one but only once per
time period. Deniability makes it possible to deny ever participating in a
protocol, while forward anonymity ensures protection even in case of a
compromise of client’s private key.  <p>
