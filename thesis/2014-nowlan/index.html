<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p> Despite alternative transport protocols more suitable to latency-sensitive
applications, TCP remains the de facto standard for Internet traffic,
including many low-latency, interactive applications. As such, applications
often tweak the TCP protocol to better suit their needs but run the risk that
any change to TCP’s wire format can cause reachability issues or complete
failure. This work presents a modified TCP implementation to reduce end-to-end
latency without modifying TCP’s wire format.

<p> Bufferbloat Resilient TCP (BBR) is a sender-side modification that detects
and mitigates instances of so-called “bufferbloat” in a TCP connection. Large
network buffers coupled with TCP’s additive increase often result in standing
queues and drastically higher round-trip times. BBR throttles the TCP sender by
identifying bufferbloat through the correlation between sending rate and delay.
A live production deployment shows BBR improves average end-to-end latency,
bandwidth efficiency and retransmissions by orders of magnitude for a video
serving platform.

<p> Random and congestive packet loss increase the latency of subsequent
packets, not just the lost packets, due to TCP’s strict in-order delivery
model. Unordered TCP (<i>u</i>TCP) is a receiver-side change that exposes to
applications out-of-order data segments that the OS normally delays in socket
buffers. This small change enables applications to build generic unordered
datagram transports and improves end-to-end latency for interactive
applications. Evaluations show that <i>u</i>TCP can approximate the latency
performance of UDP for various application workloads.
