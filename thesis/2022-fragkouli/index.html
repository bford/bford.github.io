<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p> From medical support to education and remote work, our everyday lives
increasingly depend on Internet performance. When users experience poor
performance, however, the decentralization of the Internet allows limited
visibility into which network is responsible. As a result, users are promised
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) they cannot verify, regulators make rules they
cannot enforce, and networks with competitive performance cannot reliably
showcase it to attract new customers. To change this, researchers have proposed
transparency protocols, which rely on networks reporting on their own
performance. However, these proposals would be hard to adopt because i) they
require substantial network resources for extracting and publishing the
performance information, or ii) they require cooperative networks that honestly
report their performance against their self-interests, or iii) they threaten
the anonymizing capability of Tor-like networks by violating their limited
visibility assumptions and introducing a new attack vector against them.

<p> This dissertation enables network users to estimate the loss and delay of
individual networks in an efficient and accurate manner, despite networks
generating and controlling the performance data and potentially wanting to
exaggerate their performance. It also proposes the first transparency protocol
that tries to preserve the capabilities of anonymity networks.

<p> The key to efficient and accurate performance monitoring is i) creating
incentives for networks to be honest by causing dishonest networks to get into
conflict with their neighbors, and ii) combining these incentives with
mathematical tools that “tie together” different aspects of network
performance.

<p> The key to anonymity-preserving monitoring is the insight that users can
benefit from transparency even when networks expose coarser-than-per-packet
performance information, which at the same time hides sensitive communication
patterns and improves anonymity.

<p> Our thesis is that efficient and accurate Internet performance transparency
is possible and that we can ease the tussle between transparency and user
anonymity.
