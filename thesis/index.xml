November 26, 2021  Abstract: Secure retrieval of data requires integrity, confidentially, transparency, and metadata-privacy of the process. Existing protection mechanisms, however, provide only partially these properties: encryption schemes still expose cleartext metadata, protocols for private information retrieval neglect data integrity, and data-distribution architectures forego transparency. In this dissertation, by designing new cryptographic primitives and security architectures that provide a more comprehensive protection, we improve on the current security and privacy practices in data retrieval.</description>

October 1, 2021  Abstract: Analyzing and processing data that are siloed and dispersed among multiple distrustful stakeholders is difficult and can even become impossible when the data are sensitive or confidential. Current data-protection and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) highly restrict the sharing and outsourcing of personal information among stakeholders that are in different jurisdictions.</description>

      <description>Ludovic Barman  Ph.D. thesis advised by Jean-Pierre Hubaux and Bryan Ford
September 17, 2021  Abstract:  Most communication systems (e.g., e-mails, instant messengers, VPNs) use encryption to prevent third parties from learning sensitive information. However, encrypted communications protect the contents but often leak metadata: the amount of data sent and the time it was sent, the way the data should be decrypted, the identity of the sender and the recipient.</description>

      <description>Eleftherios Kokoris Kogias  Ph.D. thesis advised by Bryan Ford
September 27, 2019  Abstract:  One of the core promises of blockchain technology is that of enabling trustworthy data dissemination in a trustless environment. What current blockchain systems deliver, however, is slow dissemination of public data, rendering blockchain technology unusable in settings where latency, transaction capacity or data confidentiality is important. In this thesis, we focus on providing solutions on two of the most pressing problems blockchain technology currently faces: scalability and data confidentiality.</description>

August 11, 2015  Abstract:  Today’s cloud computing systems pervasively rely on redundancy techniques to enhance reliability and availability. In complex multi-layered hardware/software stacks, however, seemingly independent components used redundantly might share deep, hidden dependencies. These common dependencies may potentially result in unexpected correlated failures, thus undermining redundancy efforts.  Heading off correlated failures is extremely challenging in cloud-scale systems for the following three reasons.</description>

      <description>Ewa Syta  Ph.D. thesis advised by Bryan Ford
August 11, 2015  Abstract:  Maintaining privacy on the Internet is increasingly difficult in this ever-connected world. In most cases, our online interactions are a highly personalized experience and require some form of identity verification, most commonly, logging into an account. Unfortunately, people frequently give away a lot of information while obtaining accounts, reuse usernames and passwords across different services, or link their accounts to take advantage of single sign-on to avoid retyping passwords.</description>

June 24, 2015  Abstract:  Third-party applications such as Quora or StackOverflow allow users to log in through a federated identity provider such as Facebook (Log in with Facebook), Google+ or Twitter. This process is called federated authentication. Examples of federated identity providers include social networks as well as other non-social network identity providers such as PayPal.  Federated identity providers have gained widespread popularity among users as a way to manage their online identity across the web.</description>

      <title>A Wire-Compatible TCP Implementation for Low-Latency Applications</title>

      <description>Michael F. Nowlan  Ph.D. thesis advised by Bryan Ford
March 7, 2014  Abstract:  Despite alternative transport protocols more suitable to latency-sensitive applications, TCP remains the de facto standard for Internet traffic, including many low-latency, interactive applications. As such, applications often tweak the TCP protocol to better suit their needs but run the risk that any change to TCP’s wire format can cause reachability issues or complete failure.</description>

      <description>Amittai F. Aviram  Ph.D. thesis advised by Bryan Ford
September 20, 2012  Abstract: Researchers widely agree that determinism in parallel programs is desirable. Although experimental parallel programming languages have long featured deterministic semantics, in mainstream parallel environments, developers still build on non-deterministic constructs such as mutexes, leading to time- or schedule-dependent heisenbugs. To make deterministic programming more accessible, we introduce DOMP, a deterministic extension to OpenMP, preserving the familiarity of traditional languages such as C and Fortran, and maintaining source-compatibility with much of the existing OpenMP standard.</description>
