<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p> Todayâ€™s cloud computing systems pervasively rely on redundancy techniques
to enhance reliability and availability. In complex multi-layered
hardware/software stacks, however, seemingly independent components used
redundantly might share deep, hidden dependencies. These common dependencies
may potentially result in unexpected correlated failures, thus undermining
redundancy efforts.

<p> Heading off correlated failures is extremely challenging in cloud-scale
systems for the following three reasons. First, infrastructure components and
their dependencies underlying cloud-scale redundant systems are typically very
complex. Second, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately determine the
common dependencies potentially resulting in correlated failures within
cloud-scale system environment. Third, application-level cloud services (e.g.,
iCloud) renting multiple cloud providers for redundancy cannot identify
dependencies shared by these rented cloud providers, since no cloud provider is
willing to disclose such sensitive information.

<p> This thesis proposes Independence-as-a-Service (or INDaaS), a practical and
flexible architecture to audit the independence of redundant systems
proactively, thus avoiding potential correlated failures fundamentally. INDaaS
first utilizes pluggable dependency acquisition modules to automatically
collect the structural dependency information (including network, hardware, and
software level dependencies) from a variety of sources underlying the audited
cloud services. With this information in hand, INDaaS then evaluates the
independence of redundant systems of interest using pluggable auditing modules,
offering various performance, precision, and data secrecy trade-offs. For
redundant systems across multiple cloud providers unwilling to share their full
structural information with others, INDaaS can leverage privacy-preserving set
intersection cardinality protocols to quantify the independence of the
redundant systems without leaking any sensitive information of the cloud
providers. We evaluate the practicality of INDaaS with three case studies that
audit realistic network, hardware, and software dependency structures, and
evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of INDaaS through large-scale
datasets.
