<H3>Abstract:</H3>

<p>
One of the core promises of blockchain technology is that of enabling
trustworthy data dissemination in a trustless environment. What current
blockchain systems deliver, however, is slow dissemination of public data,
rendering blockchain technology unusable in settings where latency, transaction
capacity or data confidentiality is important. In this thesis, we focus on
providing solutions on two of the most pressing problems blockchain technology
currently faces: scalability and data confidentiality.

<p>
To address the scalability issue, we present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out
distributed ledger that preserves long-term security under permissionless
operation. It ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant
public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically representative
shards that process transactions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard
commit protocol that atomically handles transactions affecting multiple shards.

<p>
To enable the secure sharing of confidential data we present Calypso, the first
fully decentralized auditable access-control framework for secure
blockchain-based data sharing which builds upon two abstractions. First,
on-chain secrets enable collective management of (verifiably shared) secrets
under a Byzantine adversary where an access-control blockchain enforces
user-specific access rules and a secret-management cothority administers
encrypted data. Second, skipchain-based identity and access management enables
efficient administration of dynamic, sovereign identities and access policies
and, in particular, permits clients to maintain long-term relationships with
respect to the evolving user identities thanks to the trust-delegating forward
links of skipchains.

<p>
In order to build OmniLedger and Calypso, we first build a set of tools for
efficient decentralization, which are presented in Part II of this
dissertation. These tools can be used in decentralized and distributed systems
to achieve (1) scalable consensus (ByzCoin), (2) biasresistant distributed
randomness creations (RandHound), and (3) relationship-keeping between
independently updating communication endpoints (Skipper). Although we use these
tools in the scope of this thesis, they can be (and already have been) used in
a far wider scope.
