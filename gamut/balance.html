<h2>Editorial versus Representative Balance</h2>

<p>
Traditional political and social-issues publications
generally fall into two camps:
those expressly and unashamedly oriented toward
particular ideologies or special interests
(e.g.,
<a href="http://www.conservativechronicle.com/">The Conservative Chronicle</a>,
<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/">The Sierra Club</a>),
and those that attempt to achieve "ideological neutrality",
or at least the image of such,
through the doctrine of <i>editorial balance</i>
(e.g., mainstream newspapers such as
<a href="http://nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>).
The doctrine of editorial balance is essentially
that journalists and editors should "fairly"
present different viewpoints from a "neutral" perspective.
But often this doctrine devolves to the simplistic strategy of
picking two opposing viewpoints and giving them roughly equal attention,
trivializing complex issues
into the black-and-white battle cries of the most vocal extremes
while ignoring middle-ground or orthogonal alternatives,
and making the two chosen sides appear equally credible
even when they are in fact highly unequal in prevalence or plausibility

 Cohen05</a>].
Further,
since editorial balance fundamentally depends on
the subjective judgments of journalists,
and those subjective judgments are in turn judged subjectively
by the public at large,
there is really no objective way for anyone to test
whether a given article is or is not in fact "balanced."
So the Right wails about the media's liberal bias
while the Left lambasts it as a conservative mouthpiece,
public confidence in the media in general plummets

and their readership divides into increasingly polarized ideological worlds

<p>
In place of the inherently subjective notion of editorial balance,
the Full Gamut pursues the fundamentally different goal of
<i>representative balance</i>,
inspired by the basic ideas of representative democracy.
The goal of representative balance is not to ensure that
<i>each individual article</i> published in the journal
is "balanced" or "unbiased" in itself,
but instead to ensure that the <i>publication as a whole</i>
accurately and proportionately represents all significant viewpoints
through a selection of articles from many different sources.
Broad-based perspectives get the most space and prominence,
while also leaving room for minority viewpoints to be aired
in unfiltered and uncensored form.
While traditional publications stake an article's claim to legitimacy
on the mere fact of its publication,
the Full Gamut accompanies each published article with statistics
reflecting its actual measured breadth of support
among the Full Gamut's volunteer editorship,
providing accurate information not only about <i>what people are thinking</i>
but also about <i>how many people think that way</i>.

<p>
In pursuing the goal of representative balance,
we make no claim that the most widespread viewpoint
is necessarily <i>right</i>,
only that giving space to articles representing different viewpoints
in proportion to their support base
is at least <i>fair</i> in an objective, quantifiable,
and democratically legitimate sense.
And while representative balance is The Full Gamut's primary goal,
editorial balance still plays a secondary role
through the Full Gamut's deliberative article selection process.
If one proposed article addresses several sides of an issue
in a way that the volunteer editors widely perceive
to be fair and unbiased,
for example,
while other competing proposals appeal only to particular smaller factions,
then the single unbiased article is much more likely to be selected,
and will receive greater prominence,
than any of the more biased alternatives.
In other words,
editorial balance can still serve as an important factor
in how the the publication's editorship subjectively judges
the overall quality of proposed articles.
