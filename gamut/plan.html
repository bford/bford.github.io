<h1>Project Plan</h1>

This plan is entirely provisional
and is certain to change as the project proceeds.
I welcome suggestions for refining the plan
and defining the project's longer-term direction, if any.

<p>
Currently envisioned project phases:
<ol>
<li>	Micro-experiment among MIT student activists:
	single-level, single-topic-area selection process.

<li>	Expand popular representation base within MIT via
	simple two-level reader-editor delegation.

<li>	Form larger Boston-area group
	using topic differentiation and editor-editor delegation
	for scalability.

<li>	Expand to other areas...?
</ol>

<i>More details to be written up soon.</i>

<!--

<h2>Phase 1: Small self-selected editorship (<100), single topic area</h2>

<h2>Phase 2: Two-level reader-editor delegation at MIT</h2>

<h2>Phase 3: Larger Boston-area editorship, topic differentiation,
	editor-editor delegation</h2>
