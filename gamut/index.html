<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Full Gamut is an experimental monthly on-line publication
designed for people with a broad interest in society and world events:
people who enjoy exposure to a variety of topics and viewpoints
that may be outside their primary interests or comfort zones,
but who have limited time to sift through
the Internet's prolific noise for meaningful signal.
The Full Gamut's goal is to pick out the very best and most important articles
currently available on the Internet on <i>any</i> topic -
the articles that <i>everyone</i> should read, for whatever reason -
while using an objectively fair selection process
to avoid systematic bias toward
particular special interests or political ideologies.

<p>
In contrast with the subjective notion of <i>editorial balance</i>
that conventional publications rely on
to limit bias among competing viewpoints,
the Full Gamut pursues the more objective goal
of <i>representative balance</i>.
Instead of trying to "balance" each individual article
among across competing viewpoints
through the judgment of a handful of editors,
the Full Gamut strives for balance across the publication as a whole
through a broader editorial body
and an article selection process derived from
basic principles of representative democracy.
The Full Gamut's selection process
allows individual articles to represent particular viewpoints
authentically and without censorship,
while ensuring that all viewpoints get attention
proportional to their support within the editorial body.
Additionally,
the Full Gamut accompanies each published article
with concrete statistics reflecting the article's support,
giving broad-minded readers useful information
not only about <i>what people are thinking</i>,
but <i>how many think that way</i>.
See the <a href="balance.html">Balance</a> page for more details.

...instead of everying being watered down
to some least-common-denominator "middle ground"
that few people really believe is actually "middle".

and not just those they more-or-less already agree with,
and who would like a "bird's-eye" perspective of
the full spectrum of our society's collective consciousness.
The Full Gamut's goal is not to steer
any particular "left, right, or center" path,
but instead to represent a diversity of viewpoints
<i>in accurate proportion to their prevalence in our society</i>.

<p>
The Full Gamut Reader will initially be a monthly on-line newsletter
consisting of a selection of links to "must-read" articles
originally published elsewhere and available online.
Each month's selection of links results from the democratic deliberation
of a nonpartisan group of volunteer editors representing
a wide variety of social classes and political perspectives.
Depending on interest and support,
the Reader may evolve later into a first-class publication
directly offering complete articles, reprints, or reviews.

The Full Gamut in its preliminary "proof of concept" phase
will rely on a small editorial body at MIT
consisting of interested students and affiliates,
particularly representatitves of existing student groups
who would like to give their interests and viewpoints
broader exposure within and perhaps beyond the MIT community.
Participants are asked to devote a few minutes to an hour per month,
depending on their free time and level of interest,
proposing, reading, and voting on articles.
Proposing an article essentially involves E-mailing me a URL,
a short one-paragraph summary/teaser,
and (if desired) the proposer's student group affiliation.
Articles can be MIT-specific, regional, or general in scope,
and can be on any topic of interest to the participants themselves
from politics and social issues to arts and games.
Voting on articles initially uses a "publication point" system
closely related to the Single Transferrable Vote (STV)
that the City of Cambridge uses to elect local representatives.
The intended result is a very short monthly E-mail newsletter/blog
linking to maybe five articles per month,
emphasizing quality and conciseness in order to maximize readership.
Future project phases will expand the editorial base
and refine the article selection process
in order to increase the publication's quality and breadth.
