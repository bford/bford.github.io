<hr>
<p>We now live in a world in which the rules coded into the technology we use
plays as important a role in governing our lives as the formal laws written in
the public law books.
<a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/01/code-is-law-html">Code is law</a> already,
for better or worse.
Unfortunately both the technology and policy communities still tend to treat
technology as a simple set of tools, like a mechanical watch, home appliance,
or automobile, which always unquestioningly serves its operator.  A smart watch
or home appliance can now monitor our behavior and report it to a company or
government, can enforce remotely-controlled rules determining when and how it
operates, and can remotely determine what content we are allowed to view or
when and for whom the smart lock on a door to our own home opens.  Today’s cars
can already be remotely disabled or attacked, and soon will be capable of
governing where we can go and when. Technology is no longer just a set of
obedient tools but, for better or worse, also an inherent part of the system of
governance that determines what individual freedoms we do and don’t have.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mindset of technology as an obedient toolset has led both
government and industry to deploy technology in ways that undermine
long-standing governance principles and undermine the basic freedoms and rights
we depend on democratic governments to uphold: principles such as rule of law,
separation of powers, and limited warrant-based search.</p>
<p>The principle of rule-of-law states that the public should have the right to
know, debate, and challenge the rules that govern their lives.  As technology
is increasingly critical in enforcing the rules by which we live, we must
demand and work to ensure that the rule-of-law principle translates properly
into the digital domain.  We have now have well-understood technology,
especially cryptographic tools, that can ensure the integrity and correctness
of publicly-known processes while keeping sensitive details private, consistent
with rule-of-law principles.  But so far we have seen little to development or
deployment of these technologies for this purpose.</p>
<p>Instead, law enforcement and surveillance agencies have shifted ever deeper
into the shadows. Ed Snowden and other whistleblowers cast much-needed light on
the proliferating morass of secret law embodied not only formally in the secret
proceedings of bodies such as the FISA court, but also the <em>de facto</em> secret law
embodied in secret mass surveillance technologies, secret stockpiles of
software exploits, and the secret agency-internal processes that purportedly
govern their use.  The secrecy and non-transparency of these processes are
antithetical to democracy and rule of law, whether embodied in secret FISA
decisions or in code and databases designed and deployed in secret by
three-letter agencies.</p>
<p>Separation of powers is intended to prevent any branch of government from
acquiring too much unaccountable power.  We also have well-understood
technology to split trust across multiple independently-operated authorities,
such as Byzantine consensus and threshold cryptography, but again it is rarely
used. In the “technology as dumb tool” mindset, government deploys
law-enforcement and surveillence technologies largely in the domain of the
executive branch.  Only that one branch effectively has any understanding of,
let alone control over, the deep technological rules and processes that
determine what protections we do and don’t have from law-enforcement and
surveillance.  Legislative and judicial oversight becomes merely a fig-leaf,
along with the whole principle of separation of powers, when no one in the
legislature or judiciary actually has any understanding of, or control over,
deep technology systems and processes deployed exclusively in the executive
branch.</p>
<p>Finally, our Fourth and Fifth amendments are intended to impose strict limits
on government searches for law-enforcement or surveillance purposes,
recognizing that that it is more important to have democratic freedoms to
defend than to catch every last criminal.  But the obsolete mindset of
technology as “dumb tools” has led many policy-makers to underestimate the
centrality of personal devices in our lives.  Policy-makers often treat
personal devices such as laptops and smartphones, and the encrypted data they
might contain, as mere possessions similar to the contents of one’s home, and
claim that law-enforcement agencies are somehow entitled to access to these
devices.  However, this mindset neglects the reality that we now carry personal
devices with us everywhere, using them as extensions of our thoughts and
memories, and to intermediate our most intimate communications.  While the
possessions in our home enjoy Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable
search and seizure, the contents of our minds also have Fifth Amendment
protections against self-incrimination.  Even if I remember committing a crime,
the government cannot force me to admit it, even with a warrant: that is, under
human-rights principles my mind is a legitimate “warrant-proof space.”  Now
that we rely on mobile personal devices to help us remember and communicate
wherever we travel, they have effectively become extensions of our minds and
bodies &ndash; and as wearables and implants proliferate they will become only more
so.  We must recognize that our Fifth amendment protections are not complete or
effective today unless they extend the warrant-proof space of our minds to the
electronic extensions embodied in our personal devices.</p>
<p>There is no pure technology solution divorced from policy, but there is also no
pure policy solution divorced from the reality of technology as a de facto
policy-enforcement mechanism.  We must intelligently integrate technology and
policy to restore the trustworthiness of democratic processes, rights, and
freedoms in the digital age.  Again, we have the technology tools to accomplish
this, but we must use them. Research on this topic that Joan and I and others
have worked on has demonstrated how technology can be married with policy
principles for a few proven law-enforcement processes such as
<a href="https://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/bandits-abs">private set-intersection of cell tower dumps</a>
and <a href="https://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/wpes16-chaining-abs">privacy-preserving contact chaining</a>.
We can and must design technology to uphold rule-of-law, by transparently
enforcing public processes for law enforcement and surveillance while keeping
details of investigations and non-targeted users private.  We can and must
design technology to enforce separation of powers, such that systems
independently operated by each branch cooperate and keep each other in check in
implementing electronic law-enforcement and surveillance processes.  We must
work to ensure that technology used in law-enforcement and surveillance
verifiably adheres to the strict limits the Fourth Amendment allows for search
of ordinary possessions and business records. Finally, our law-enforcement and
surveillance technologies must respect the contents of our
electronically-augmented minds as legitimate warrant-proof spaces essential to
upholding our freedoms of thought, speech, and association.</p>
<p>In summary, we must discard the obsolete mindset of technology as merely a set
of dumb tools and recognize that technology has become, for better worse, an
integral part of our system of governance that determines what rights and
freedoms we all do and don’t have.  Technologists need to recognize this, and
work closely with the policy community to ensure that the policy principles
underlying our basic individual freedoms are not “lost in translation” to
digital society.</p>
