Early Projects</h1></center>

On the <a href="http://www.amiga.com">Amiga</a> computer:
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>Amiga Mach:</b> A port of the Mach 3.0 microkernel to the Amiga, which
is how I got into Mach (and microkernels) in the first place. This was
the first fully non-proprietary 680x0 port. Unfortunately, the project
sort of fizzled after we got the microkernel running reliably, because
there was no usable, freely available Unix server.</li>

<li><p>
<b>MultiPlayer:</b> A powerful, user-friendly, and very popular Shareware
music player for the Amiga. Available on <a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/util/pack/">ftp.wustl.edu</a>
or any other <a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/README">aminet</a>
FTP site.</li>

<li><p>
<b>XPK <i>(eXternal PacKer)</i>:</b> A cooperating set of programs for
the Amiga together comprising a complete data compression system. XPK allows
many different compression algorithms to be used transparently by many
different applications, through a standard <i>master</i> library. The master
library provides a convenient high-level interface to applications, and
at the same time, offloads most of the grungy administrative tasks themselves
from the actual algorithms implementing compression. Many people have contributed
compression algorithms, applications, drivers, and other components to
the XPK system, and it has become a <i>de facto</i> standard for many aspects
of data compression on the Amiga. My part in the project was in the design
of the master library and one of the first compression libraries (a form
of the well-known LZW algorithm). The complete XPK system can be gotten
from <a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/util/pack/">ftp.wustl.edu</a>
or any other <a href="ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/README">aminet</a>
FTP site.</li>

<li><p>
<b>Chroma Paint:</b> A full-featured commercial paint program for the Amiga
I wrote years ago and marketed through a small company in Logan, Utah.
Didn't sell real well, but it was a fun experience.</li>
</ul>
