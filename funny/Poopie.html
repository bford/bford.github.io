The kind where you feel the poopie come out, but there is no poopie in
the toilet.</dd>

<dt>
Clean Poopie</dt>

The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing
on the toilet paper.</dd>

<dt>
Wet Poopie</dt>

<dd>
The kind where you wipe your butt 50 times and it still feels unwiped,
so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and underwear so
you won't ruin them with stains.</dd>

<dt>
Second Wave Poopie</dt>

<dd>
This happens when you're done poopie-ing and you've pulled up your pants
to your knees, and you realize that you have to poopie some more.</dd>

<dt>
Pop-A-Vein-In-Your-Forehead-Poopie</dt>

<dd>
The kind where you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a
stroke.</dd>

<dd>
It's so noisy that everyone within earshot starts giggling.</dd>

<dt>
Drinker Poopie</dt>

<dd>
Occurs after a long night of drinking. Its most noticeable trait is the
skid marks in the toilet bowl.</dd>

<dt>
Lincoln Log Poopie</dt>

<dd>
The kind of poopie that is so big, you're afraid to flush without first
breaking it into little pieces with the toilet brush.</dd>

<dt>
Liquid Plumber Poopie</dt>

This kind is so huge it plugs up the toilet and overflows all over the
floor.&nbsp; You should have followed the advice from Lincoln Log Poopie.</dd>

Corn Poopie</dt>

<dd>
Self-explanatory.</dd>

<dt>
Gee-I-Wish-I-Could-Poopie Poopie</dt>

cramped, and fart a few times.</dd>

sideways.</dd>

<dt>
I-Think-I'm-Giving-Birth-Through-My-Asshole Poopie</dt>

<dt>
Wet Cheeks Poopie (The Power Dump)</dt>

<dd>
The kind that comes out so fast, your butt gets splashed with water.</dd>

<dt>
Liquid Poopie</dt>

<dd>

The kind where you have to wipe so many times
it feels like you've sanded off most of the skin on your butt.

either flush and continue, or risk it piling up to your butt while you
sit there helpless.</dd>

Bunny Poopie</dt>

<dd>
When you drop lots of little round turds that look like marbles and make
tiny splashing sounds when they hit the water.</dd>

but oops...a poopie!!!</dd>

<dt>
Dangling Poopie</dt>

<dd>
This kind refuses to drop into the toilet even though you are done poopie-ing
it. You just pray that a shake or two will cut it loose, because if you
wipe now it'll smear all over the place.</dd>

<dt>
Fisherman's Bobber Poopie</dt>

<dd>
You are in a public restroom with two people waiting on your stall, you
poopie and flush two times, but several golfball pieces are still floating
above the water line.</dd>
