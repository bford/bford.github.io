<h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
</center>

<p>
Everybody's getting cancer<BR>
At a geometrical rate<BR>
Maybe it's something you drank or breathed<BR>
Maybe it's something you ate<BR>
Perhaps this doesn't concern you<BR>
Hey, we've all gotta go sometime<BR>
But maybe I can tell you something<BR>
To make you change your mind<BR>
<BR>
<I>(Chorus)<BR>
The alligator dicks are shriveling up<BR>
Soon they'll all be through<BR>
Yeah, the alligator dicks are shrinking fast<BR>
And it will happen to you<BR>
It will happen to you, boys<BR>
It will happen to you<BR>
the alligator dicks are shriveling up<BR>
and it will happen to you</I><BR>
<BR>
They're an indicator species<BR>
Like canaries in the mine<BR>
They're the first to kick the bucket<BR>
When things might otherwise seem fine<BR>
So let's be frank and honest<BR>
As the situation begs<BR>
Boys, what are you gonna do<BR>
About that thing between your legs<BR>
<BR>
<I>(Chorus)</I><BR>
<BR>
I'm not beating around the bush<BR>
I'm making you a promise<BR>
Say goodbye to Long Dong Silver<BR>
Hello to Tiny Thomas<BR>
You can forget about Viagra<BR>
Boys, what I mean is<BR>
It's all a matter of minutiae<BR>
When you've got a half-inch penis<BR>
<BR>
<I>(Chorus)</I><BR>
<BR>
PCBs in the water<BR>
Pesticides in the ground<BR>
Radiation in the wind<BR>
There's poison all around<BR>
So if you care about your love life<BR>
And that good old whoop-dee-doo<BR>
We've got to stop pollution, boys<BR>
That's what i'm telling you<BR>
<BR>
<I>(Chorus)</I><BR>

<p>
This little tune takes an unapologetically direct approach
at some of the reasons we should care about the environment...
