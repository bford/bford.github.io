<p style="line-height: 125%">Accepted September 19, 1995</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">The development of the male
reproductive ducts and external genitalia in vertebrates is dependent on
elevated androgen concentrations during embryonic development and the period of
postnatal growth. We have observed that a population of juvenile alligators
living on Lake Apopka exhibit significantly smaller penis size (24% average
decrease) and lower plasma concentrations of testosterone (70% lower
concentrations) when compared to animals of similar size on Lake Woodruff. In
addition to smaller phalli, no relationship exists between plasma testosterone
concentrations and penile size in males from Lake Apopka, whereas a positive
relationship exists for males from Lake Woodruff. The alligators on Lake Apopka
are known to have elevated concentrations of the antiandrogenic DDT breakdown
product p,p'-DDE stored in their fat. We suggest a number of hypotheses that
could explain the modification in the phenotype of the juvenile male living in
Lake Apopka. These modifications in phenotype include a smaller penis size,
lower plasma androgen concentrations, and lack of responsiveness of the penis to
the plasma androgens present.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">In vertebrates, the development of
the male internal reproductive ducts and external genitalia is largely dependent
on the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. These sex steroids are
responsible for the differentiation of the Wolffian duct into the male internal
duct system as well as the formation of the external genitalia in reptiles (see
Raynaud and Pieau, 1985). During embryonic development in alligators, secretion
of androgens and Müllerian-inhibiting hormone from the testis produces an
internal anatomy similar to that commonly described in other reptiles (Austin,
1989, 1990). In addition to embryologically organizing the male reproductive
system, androgens are also responsible for stimulating the ontogenetic
development of this system during juvenile (especially during puberty) and adult
periods (Raynaud and Pieau, 1985). Additionally, seasonal fluctuations in the
secretory activity and size of the testis and glands of the reproductive system
are androgen dependent (Licht, 1984; Raynaud and Pieau, 1985).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Reptiles exhibit three distinctly
different patterns of copulatory organ development, as the squamates (lizards
and snakes) have paired hemipenes, the turtles and crocodiles (includes
alligators and caiman) have a single penis, and the tuatara have no copulatory
organ (Raynaud and Pieau, 1985). There has been an extensive debate on the
homologies of the various copulatory organs in reptiles over the last century
but a conclusion is still forthcoming. The available data suggest that the
embryological development of the hemipenes in squamates is less complex than
that seen in turtles (for a review see Raynaud and Pieau, 1985). Little is known
of the embryological development of the copulatory organ in crocodilians. It is
apparent that the crocodilian males and females have a homologous structure
generally similar in gross morphology. It has been termed the cliteropenis by
some workers (see Raynaud and Pieau, 1985; Allsteadt and Lang, 1995), whereas
others use the term penis or phallus for this structure in males to denote its
functional role (Forbes, 1939; Ramaswani and Jacob, 1965). Even in light of the
possible lack of homology between squamate hemipenes and the chelonian or
crocodilian penis, all available studies indicate that the steroid environment
during embryonic development directly influences the development of the
copulatory organ. That is, growth and differentiation of the penile anlagen in
some reptilian species is stimulated by the presence of androgens, as reported
for eutherian mammals, whereas in other species phallic development is inhibited
by estrogens, as observed in birds (Raynaud and Pieau, 1985).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Androgens are essential for normal
maturation and growth of the male reproductive system in reptiles. Seasonal
growth of the testis produces elevated plasma concentrations of testosterone
that are directly correlated with increased reproductive tract weight and
synthesis of protein secretory products (Licht, 1984; Raynaud and Pieau, 1985).
Exogenous androgen treatment of orchidectomized males reestablished reproductive
tract growth and secretory activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that
phallus growth is androgen dependent in alligators (Forbes, 1939) and
crocodilians (Ramaswani and Jacob, 1965), as observed in other reptiles (Raynaud
and Pieau, 1985) and in mammals (van Teinhoven, 1983). Interestingly, Ramaswani
and Jacob (1965) observed that the penis of juvenile Indian mugger crocodile <i>(Crocodylus
palustris) </i>exhibited the greatest androgen responsiveness of any male
reproductive organ they examined, which included the secondary sexual ducts, the
Wolffian duct, and the renal sex segment of the kidney. Likewise, recent studies
have shown that significant penis growth in juvenile alligators can be induced
by exogenous treatment with pharmacological levels of testosterone or
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Jeff Lang, personal communication), whereas treatment
with DHT at lower concentrations stimulated no significant growth in juvenile female
alligators (Pickford, 1995). It should be noted that, in alligators, incubation
temperature also influences the size of the clitoris in females, with females
derived from eggs incubated at near male temperatures exhibiting larger
clitorides than females from eggs incubated at lower temperatures (Allsteadt and
Lang, 1995). However, the size, shape, and coloration of the phallic structures
in 3month-old juvenile males and females are distinctive, allowing the correct
diagnosis of sex 96% of the time (Allsteadt and Lang, 1995). Thus, phallus size
could represent an obvious marker of abnormal androgen concentrations or
functioning in reptiles as has been reported for mammals.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">A number of environmental
contaminants act as cellular signal transduction modifiers (Colborn <i>et al., </i>1993;
McLachlan, 1993; McLachlan <i>et al., </i>1992). These contaminants interact
with various cellular receptors-genetic transcription factors-so as to act as
endocrine system agonists or antagonists. The vast majority of the compounds
studied to date appear to bind to the vertebrate estrogen receptor, acting as
xenoestrogens or antiestrogens (McLachlan, 1981, 1993; Safe <i>et al., </i>1991;
Soto <i>et al., </i>1992, 1994; Peterson <i>et al., </i>1993). Exposure to these
compounds during embryonic development can have either catastrophic (e.g.,
mortality, cancer) or subtle (e.g., changes in enzyme function) effects as they
are capable of modifying the organization of differentiating cells and organs
(for discussion, see Guillette <i>et al., </i>1995a).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">A series of recent studies suggests
that endocrine-disrupting contaminants can interact with other cellular receptor
types, such as the androgen receptor (Gray <i>et al., </i>1993; Kelce <i>et al.,
</i>1994). For example, the fungicide vinclozolin is not an active endocrine
system antagonist until it is metabolized to produce two compounds that act as
antiandrogens. Exposure of developing rats to various doses of vinclozolin via
maternal exposure produced a series of developmental abnormalities of the
reproductive system in male offspring, including cryptorchidism, cleft phallus,
hypospadias, and strophic seminal vesicles and prostate glands (Gray <i>et al., </i>1993;
Kelce <i>et al., </i>1994).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Abnormalities of the male
reproductive system have been reported in wildlife living in wetlands known to
be contaminated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (for a review see Colborn <i>et
al., </i>1993). For example, male alligators hatched from eggs collected from a
contaminated lake in Florida, Lake Apopka, exhibit a number of developmental
abnormalities such as depressed plasma testosterone concentrations, elevated
testicular estradiol synthesis <i>in vitro, </i>and aberrant cellular structures
in the seminiferous tubules (Guillette <i>et al., </i>1994, 1995b). The
underlying cause of these abnormalities, as well as the reported developmental
problems in females, has been hypothesized to be due to &quot;estrogenic&quot;
contaminants. The principal contaminant found in alligator eggs (Heinz <i>et
al., </i>1991) and juveniles (EPA, 1994) collected from Lake Apopka is p,p'-DDE,
a major persistent metabolite of DDT. Although DDT has been reported to be
estrogenic (Bulger and Kupfer, 1983; Fry and Toone, 1981), a controversy exists
as to whether p,p'-DDE is estrogenic or not (see Soto <i>et al., </i>1992, 1994;
Kelce <i>et al., </i>1995). However, using traditional receptor binding assays
and a transfected yeast-androgen receptor system, Kelce <i>et al. </i>(1995)
have demonstrated that p,p'-DDE binds the androgen receptor preferentially
compared to the estrogen receptor and acts in the yeast system as an
antiandrogen. It is the relative ratio of androgens to estrogens found in the
plasma that creates an estrogenic or androgenic hormonal milieu. The presence of
an antiandrogen would create an estrogenic environment by decreasing native
androgen relative to estrogenic activity. These observations suggest the
hypothesis that the abnormalities seen in the alligators from Lake Apopka may be
due to an estrogenic environment produced not by the presence of an estrogenic
contaminant but by the antiandrogenic action of p,p-'DDE. If elevated levels of
an antiandrogenic compound were present in the tissues of embryonic and juvenile
alligators at Lake Apopka, one would predict that androgen-dependent structures
would be affected. Although p,p'-DDE is the primary suspect and is found in the
greatest concentration in eggs and juveniles, it is important to note that many
other compounds are present in Lake Apopka due to agricultural and municipal use
and the concentrations of these compounds in eggs have not been examined. It is
likely that the effects we observe in alligators could be due to the cumulative
effect of a number of compounds. The purpose of this study is to examine the
relationship between plasma testosterone concentrations and penis size in
animals from a contaminated and a control lake. As penis size is dependent on
circulating androgen concentrations during fetal and juvenile development, it
represents an excellent marker of normal or abnormal steroid-induced
development.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 125%">MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Animals and morphometrics. </i>Juvenile
alligators (Al<i>ligator mississippiensis) </i>were collected at night by hand
from two lakes in central Florida approximately 65 km apart. Lake Woodruff
National Wildlife Refuge, Florida, was chosen as one study lake due to its
relatively pristine nature as there is no agriculture or industry and only a few
residences directly adjacent to the lake. On a single night (May 1994), 40 male
and 15 female alligators were obtained from Lake Woodruff and adjacent
marshlands. The following night, we hand-captured 54 males and 18 females from
two localities on Lake Apopka, Florida. An additional 11 males and 2 females
were caught on Lake Apopka during late April 1995. Sex was determined by the
presence of a penis (dark pink to red in color) that could be extruded from the
cloaca by manual pressure. Males averaged (±1 SEM, range) 35.7 cm (±0.7,
25.851.3) snout vent length (SVL), whereas females exhibited a mean SVL of 38.3
cm (±2.8, 23.0-63.0). Lake Apopka is a large eutrophic lake that has been
exposed to various agricultural and municipal contaminants. Lake Apopka is also
associated with a major pesticide (dicofol and DDT and its metabolites DDE and
DDD) and sulfuric acid spill from the Tower Chemical Company that occurred in
1980 (U.S. EPA, unpublished report). Animals on Lake Apopka were captured from
the Gourd Neck locality, adjacent to an unnamed stream that drained the Tower
Chemical Company Superfund site. The Gourd Neck area was also extensively
surrounded by citrus fields until the freezes of the mid-1980s. A second group
of animals was collected along the northwest shore of the lake, approximately 8
km (linear shore length) from the Gourd Neck area.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Following capture, animals were
placed in cloth bags and returned to a central site where a 1.5-ml blood sample
was removed from the postcranial sinus of each animal. All samples were
collected within 1 h of capture. Whole-blood samples were placed in a
heparinized Vacutainer tube and stored on ice for 6 hr. Upon return to the
laboratory, samples were centrifuged and plasma was collected, snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70° until assayed for plasma testosterone
concentration (see assay description below).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">After the blood sample was
collected, all animals were measured [total length (TL) and SVL] to the nearest
millimeter. The animals were then sexed by extrusion of the penis by manual
palpation of the base of the cloaca. Male and female alligators have a
cliterophallic structure that is similar in general shape although significantly
different in size, coloration (dark pink to dark red in males versus a very
light pink to white in females), and degree to which it can be manually extruded
from the cloaca (Allsteadt and Lang, 1995; L. J. Guillette, Jr., and A. R.
Woodward, unpublished data). If male, the length of the penis tip and width of
the penis cuff (see <a href="#F1"> Fig. 1</a>) were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using a dial
caliper with needle tips. All measurements were made by a single researcher to
minimize and standardize measurement error. All animals were then tagged with a
unique toe tag and returned to their capture locality. For a detailed
description of gross genital morphology of the alligator, see Allsteadt and Lang
(1995) or Pickford (1995).<a name="F1"><br>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Due to the greatly reduced size of
the penis in many males from Lake Apopka, and the fact that the cliteropenis of
male and female alligators is similar in basic structure (see Allsteadt and
Lang, 1995; Pickford, 1995), a source of error in sexing animals is possible.
That is, the greatly reduced male phallus could appear similar to a slightly
enlarged female clitoris. Allsteadt and Lang (1995) have reported that some
females from eggs incubated at elevated temperatures have an enlarged
cliterophallus although it is always at the lower end of normal size in
hatchling and young juveniles. However, the larger than normal cliterophallus in
these females does not have the coloration of a male phallus nor can it be
distended by manual pressure at the base of the cloaca as can be done with
males. Nevertheless, we performed analyses on a subset of the data, in which all
males having a phallus tip smaller than 3.0 mm were excluded. Juvenile females
of the size used in this study do not have clitoris tips larger than
approximately 2.0 mm and thus, if by chance we have included females in our
&quot;male&quot; data set, the analysis of the subset would presumably remove
this bias.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Radioimmunoassay (RIA). </i>As
significant seasonal variation can exist in plasma androgen concentrations, only
the plasma from animals captured in May was assayed and reported under Results.
Additionally, samples from 24 males were lost due to a freezer malfunction.
Thus, the sample sizes are reduced compared to the available data for
morphometric analyses.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Antisera for the androgen RIA were
obtained from Endocrine Sciences<sup>1</sup> (Calabasas Hills, CA). The testosterone
antibody has the following cross-reactivities: dihydrotestosterone, 44%; <img border="0" src="Alligator-Penis-Apopka-GuilletteA.GIF" width="13" height="15">-1-testosterone, 41%;

0.5%; all other cross-reactivities are less than 0.2%. Radiolabeled testosterone
(TRK 402; 102 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc. (Arlington
Heights, IL). Testosterone standard was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO), and all other chemicals were obtained from Fisher Chemical Co.
(Pittsburgh, PA).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Alligator plasma samples (100 µl;
all samples and standards performed in duplicate) were extracted twice with
ethyl ether to remove the lipophilic steroids. After drying the sample ether
extracts with filtered, low-humidity air, the samples were resuspended with 100
w1 borate buffer (0.5 M, pH 8.0). Androgen antibody (100 t,1; final dilution
1:36,000), BSA/ borate buffer (100 µl; 0.5 M borate buffer, 7.5% BSA),</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">and radiolabeled testosterone (100 µl
of 9000 cpm) were added and the tubes were vortexed and incubated overnight
at 4°. Bound-free separation was accomplished by adding 500 A.1 of 5%
charcoal/0.5% dextran and centrifuging the tubes for 30 min at 2000 g. The
supernatant was decanted, diluted with scintillation cocktail, and counted on a
Beckman LS 5801 scintillation counter. Concentrations were estimated by
commercially available software (Beckman Instruments).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Extraction efficiency was
determined by spiking 100 µl of pooled alligator plasma with tritiated
testosterone (approx 10,000 cpm) and determining the amount of label in the
ether extract. To validate the androgen RIA for alligator plasma, plasma
dilutions and internal standards were performed on a pool of alligator plasma
samples. For plasma dilutions, plasma from the pool was aliquanted in 3-, 6-,
12-, 25-, 50-, 75-, and 100-µl amounts. These volumes were supplemented with
plasma stripped of steroids (10 ml plasma + 1 g charcoal, 12-hr incubation,
centrifuge and collect supernatant) such that all samples had 100 t.1. For
internal standards, steroid-free plasma (100 A1) was spiked with 6.25, 12.5, 25,
50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 pg of testosterone. Both plasma dilutions and
internal standards were extracted and assayed as described previously.
Parallelism among the plasma dilution curve, internal standard curve, and
standard curve was tested for homogeneity of slopes using the SuperANOVA
statistical software program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">The minimum detectable dose in the
assay was 29 pg/ml. Interassay variability was 15.6%, and intraassay variability
averaged 4.3%. Extraction efficiency averaged 97%. The standard curve, plasma
dilution curve, and internal standard curve were parallel, exhibiting
homogeneity of slopes <i>(F = 2</i>.43, <i> P</i> = 0.127).</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Statistics. </i>Data on the length
of the penis tip, diameter of the penis cuff, and plasma testosterone
concentration were analyzed for differences among lake localities using one-way
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with body size (total length or snout vent
length) as the independent variable. Values for these parameters were log
transformed prior to analysis to achieve homogeneity of variance. However, the
least-squares means reported in the text are back-transformed to real values.
Where significant (P &lt; 0.05) variation existed, Scheffé's F test was used for</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">post hoc testing of individual
paired comparisons. These analyses were performed using the SuperANOVA software
program (Abacus Concepts, 1989). Additionally, regression analyses were
performed comparing penis morphometric characteristics versus body size
measurements (snout vent length, total body length) or plasma testosterone
concentration of individual animals (Stat-View II, Abacus Concepts, 1988).</p>
<h4 style="line-height: 125%">RESULTS</h4>
<i>
<p style="line-height: 125%">Penis morphometrics. </i>We observed that the
length of the penis tip and the diameter of the penis cuff
were correlated with body size in juvenile males from
two of three localities examined (<a href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). No
relationship existed between penis size and body size in the
Gourd Neck area of Lake Apopka (Fig. 2). Snout vent
length explained over 59% of the variation in the diameter
of the penis cuff and in the length of the penis tip
on Lake Woodruff, whereas on the northwest shore of Lake Apopka, SVL was able to explain only 37% of
the variation seen in the diameter of the penis cuff
and 34% of the variation observed in the length of the
penis tip. Although a relationship between body
length and penis size, either tip length or cuff diameter,
existed in two localities, a significant difference
in the size of the penis was seen among all lake
localities. Penis tip length (adjusted for TL, <i>F = </i> 3.8, <i>df
= </i> 1,94, <i> P </i> = 0.025; adjusted for SVL, <i>F = </i> 3.5, <i>df = </i>1,94<i>,
P </i> = 0.03) and the diameter of the penis cuff (adjusted for TL, <i>F
= </i> 3.8
<i>
df </i>=1,94, <i> P</i> = 0.025; adjusted for SVL, <i>F = 4</i>.03,
<i>df </i>=1,94, <i>P</i> = 0.02) were significantly larger on Lake
Woodruff even after differences in body size were accounted
for (<a href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). A significant difference in penis size
was also observed between males from the two locations on Lake Apopka (Fig. 3). The difference observed in
the length of the penis tip between animals caught on Lake Woodruff and Lake Apopka, after adjustment
for snout vent length, indicated that a 24% difference
in average length existed-13% reduction for animals caught on the northwest shore and 35% reduction for
those caught in the Gourd Neck area. However, it is important to note that a difference in the length
of the penis tip and the diameter of the penis cuff
occurred in all size classes of juveniles when the two lakes
were compared.</p>

<h4 style="line-height: 125%">DISCUSSION</h4>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Male alligators from Lake Apopka
had a significantly smaller phallus and lower plasma testosterone
concentrations. Further, unlike males on the control lake, no relationship was
observed between phallus size and plasma androgen concentration nor did phallus
dimensions exhibit allometric relationships with body size for males obtained in
the Gourd Neck area of Lake Apopka. We noted differences between collection
sites on Lake Apopka. Juveniles living in the Gourd Neck area, near the entry
site of the Tower Chemical Company pesticide spill, exhibited significantly
reduced penis size and plasma testosterone when compared to juvenile male
alligators living along the northwestern shore, which themselves exhibited
reductions compared to the control lake. As reported previously for yearling
alligators from Lake Apopka (Guillette et al., 1994), wild juvenile males
collected during this study had plasma testosterone concentrations similar to
those found in females.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">The increased frequency of
developmental abnormalities of male phallic structures, as reported in humans
(Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 1993), fish (Davis and Bortone, 1992), and alligators
(this study), is most easily explained by hypothesizing that androgen
functioning has been reduced during embryonic development and early life.
Several hypotheses can be developed to explain the reduced penis size in the
juvenile male alligators from Lake Apopka: (1) males may have reduced plasma
androgen concentrations that would result in reduced stimulation of the penis
and, thus, reduced growth; (2) the relative ratio of testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone could be altered by the suppression of the enzyme
5a-reductase, resulting in reduced penis size; (3) reduced numbers of androgen
receptors on phallic tissue would also result in a reduction in size; (4) the
presence of an androgen antagonist that would effectively compete for the
androgen receptor and block normal androgen stimulation could also produce
depressed phallus growth; and (5) the presence of a xenobiotic estrogen could
shift the ratio of estrogens to androgens toward a feminizing environment in the
developing embryo, thus blocking phallic development or inducing a female
phenotype poorly responsive to androgens later in life. These hypotheses are not
exclusive and all may contribute to a reduction in penis size to some degree.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">The significantly reduced plasma
testosterone concentrations could explain small phallus size in male alligators
from Lake Apopka. Penis growth in male and female alligators and crocodiles can
be stimulated by exogenous administration of either testosterone or
dihydrotestosterone (Forbes, 1939; 1940; Ramaswani and Jacob, 1965; J. Lang,
personal communication). Presumably, a lack or significant reduction in the
circulating concentrations of these hormones would produce animals with reduced
penis size. The data reported in this study confirm that sub-adult males of many
age groups from Lake Apopka exhibit depressed plasma testosterone
concentrations. We have previously shown that 6-month-old alligators hatched
from eggs collected from Lake Apopka have severely reduced plasma concentrations
of testosterone (Guillette <i>et al., </i>1994). This
study indicates that this reduction in plasma androgen is not transitory,
occurring in neonates or yearlings only, but persists in animals much older in
age.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">What is responsible for the reduced
plasma testosterone concentrations? When testes, obtained from juvenile
alligators from a contaminated and a control lake, were cultured <i> in</i> <i>vitro </i>no
difference in androgen synthesis was detected (Guillette <i>et al., </i>1995b).
We have hypothesized that the reduced plasma androgen levels in hatchling and
juvenile alligators from Lake Apopka (Guillette <i>et al., </i>1994) are due to
modifications in liver degradation of androgens or modifications in the
synthesis of plasma proteins responsible for binding steroids. (Guillette and
Crain, 1995; Guillette <i>et al., </i>1995b). Although mean plasma androgen
concentrations are different between the males caught on the two lakes, it is
very obvious that the major differences in plasma testosterone exist in the
larger size classes. If animals are examined based on size class, it appears
that males larger than 80 cm total length, from a pristine environment, show a
significant increase in plasma testosterone concentration. These data suggest
that plasma androgen concentrations do not exhibit a simple linear relationship
with body size in juvenile alligators of all sizes. Moreover, since plasma
androgen concentrations do not show elevations in larger sized males from Lake
Apopka, we may conclude that the differences in penis size are exclusively due
to the significant depression of plasma androgen alone. However, differences in
penis size are also seen in very small alligators that had similar plasma
androgen concentrations, suggesting that other factors may be involved with the
observed differences. These factors appear to be acting during development or
the early neonatal growth period.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">A deficiency in the activity of the
enzyme 5<img border="0" src="Alligator-Penis-Apopka-GuilletteX.GIF" width="12" height="15">-reductase, responsible for the conversion of testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone, has been shown to produce a specific form of male
pseudohermaphroditism in which the external genitalia are poorly developed and
small in size (Impert-McGinley <i>et al., </i>1979). Specifically, these males
have ambiguous or very small copulatory organs at birth that will, in some
individuals, grow with the onset of puberty. This pattern of abnormal
development is observed due to the specificity of androgen action during
embryonic develop</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">ment and organization of the male
genital anlagen. That is, the differentiation of the external genitalia and
prostate gland in male mammals appears dependent on adequate concentrations of
dihydrotestosterone, whereas testosterone controls the development of the
internal urogenital tract composed of the vas deferens, epididymis, and seminal
vesicles. Little data exist on the ratio of testosterone to DHT during normal
development in male reptiles. In the adult males examined, plasma testosterone
concentrations appear always to be significantly elevated over plasma DHT
concentrations (Bourne, 1991). We have no information on the activity of the
enzyme 5<img border="0" src="Alligator-Penis-Apopka-GuilletteX.GIF" width="12" height="15">-reductase but a preliminary study has shown that circulating
concentrations of DHT in juvenile alligators are very low or nondetectable with
no apparent difference between males from Lake Woodruff and Lake Apopka
(Pickford, 1995).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Two alternative hypotheses to
explain reduced phallus size are associated with either a reduction in androgen
receptor frequency and distribution or the presence of an androgen antagonist-an
antiandrogen. In mammals, the lack of androgen receptors-testicular feminization
or androgen insensitivity syndrome-produces a condition where the male phenotype
does not develop and XY individuals develop the external genitalia normal of
females (Wilson and Foster, 1985). In mice, perinatal exposure to the synthetic
estrogen diethylstilbestrol significantly reduces the number of androgen
receptors in the prostate and seminal vesicle of male offspring (see Bern,
1992). Many of these mice exhibit reduced phallus size and modifications of the
male reproductive tract. To our knowledge, there are no data on the frequency
and distribution of androgen receptors in the alligator reproductive tract.
Future studies must examine the natural distribution of androgen receptors in
the reproductive system of embryonic, neonatal, juvenile, and sexually mature
male and female reptiles.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">Reduced androgen activity can be
produced by the presence of an antiandrogenic substance. The effects of
administration of antiandrogenic substances to developing mammals has been
studied and one study examining the effect of antiandrogens during embryonic
development has been performed in reptiles (Wibbels and Crews, 1992).
Specifically, the administration of an antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide, to
embryonic red-eared turtles incubated at a temperature that induces 100% males, induced
sex reversal-females-in 6% of the eggs treated (Wibbels and Crews, 1992). Neither
the size nor the differentiation of the phallus was examined in this study (D.
Crews, personal communication).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">A number of environmental
contaminants bind to hormone receptors and block normal hormonal functions. The
fungicide vinclozolin, for example, is an androgen antagonist. Two metabolites
of vinclozolin bind to the androgen receptor and block its function, causing
demasculinization (but not complete feminization) of male rats exposed to this
contaminant's breakdown products in <i>utero </i>(Kelce <i>et al., </i>1994).
Likewise, recent studies have indicated that a persistent metabolite of DDT, p,p'-DDE,
is a relatively potent antiandrogen (Kelce <i>et al., </i>1995), especially
given its elevated concentrations in many organisms due to its ability to
bioaccumulate and biomagnify in individuals feeding at higher levels of the food
chain (for examples, see Clark and Krynitsky, 1985; Heinz <i>et al., </i>1991;
Rattner <i>et al., </i>1984; Roelke <i>et al., </i>1991; Subramanian <i>et al., </i>1987;
Williams <i>et al., </i>1988). Juvenile alligators from Lake Apopka have
elevated concentrations of p,p'-DDE (range 1.6-8.5 ppm) in their fat tissue
(EPA, 1994). Alligator eggs collected from nests on Lake Apopka during the
mid-1980s also had elevated concentrations of p,p'-DDE (Heinz <i>et al., </i>1991).
It is likely that this contaminant could act as an androgen antagonist in
embryonic and juvenile alligators. In embryonic males, it could modify the
organization of the penis, thus disrupting its responsiveness to an androgen
signal later in life. This hypothesis may explain the absence of a relationship
between phallus size and plasma testosterone concentrations in juvenile males
from Lake Apopka. That is, a modification in the endocrine signals associated
with embryonic development would consequently alter the responsiveness of male
reproductive tract tissue to the activational stimulus of androgen later in life
(for a general discussion of these concepts as they relate to contaminants, see
Guillette <i>et al., </i>1995a). Thus, the males from Lake Apopka could exhibit
a &quot;female&quot; phenotype and exhibit poor responsiveness to androgen
stimulation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="line-height: 125%">A number of hypotheses suggest
conditions that would produce male offspring lacking a phallus or with a phallus
reduced in size. Following their initial studies with the antiandrogenic
fungicide vinclozolin, E. Gray, W. Kelce, and colleagues proposed that the abnormalities of the penis and male
reproductive system seen in the rodents they treated could be due to a DHT
deficiency or receptor antagonism. Their follow-up studies indicated that 5<img border="0" src="Alligator-Penis-Apopka-GuilletteX.GIF" width="12" height="15">-reductase activity was not altered in the male offspring exposed to the
antiandrogenic metabolites of vinclozolin (Gray <i>et al., </i>1993; Kelce <i>et
al., </i>1994). Instead, the developmental abnormalities observed appeared to be
due directly to the inhibition of gene transcription by a blockage of the
activity of the androgen receptor (Kelce <i>et al., </i>1994, 1995). p, p'-DDE
binds to the androgen receptor in <i>vitro </i>and blocks androgen
receptor-induced gene transcription in a transfected yeast assay (Kelce <i>et
al., </i>1995). As p, p'-DDE represents the organochlorine pesticide found, to
date, to be in the greatest concentration in the alligators from Lake Apopka, it
suggests that future studies must examine the ability of this DDT metabolite to
bind the reptilian androgen receptor. Further, we must begin to understand what
factors) alters the development of male alligator embryos from Lake Apopka so as
to produce neonates and juveniles with reduced plasma androgen concentrations.
It is clear from the hypotheses discussed above that a number of interacting
factors could produce reduced phallus size. Future studies must test these
hypothesis and also determine if phallus reduction represents a biomarker of
permanent abnormalities of the reproductive system in these reptiles.</p>
