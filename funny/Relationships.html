How to f*** up</h1></center>

(The classic <a href="http://www.polyamory.org/">alt.polyamory</a> FAQ
Supplement)</h2></center>
The preceding list of answers to questions about polyamory is not a guide
to how to have a working polyamorous relationship, although we have strong
anecdotal evidence that the tools mentioned are useful in all sorts of
relationships, mono and poly. We do, however, have the following guide
of carefully tested methods for making mistakes in polyamorous relationships.
With proper application and ingenuity, these methods may impair or destroy
monogamous relationships as well; they're truly multipurpose tools. We
post this listing for your consideration; no liability expressed or implied.
<p>1. Lie. This is basic and effective. To maximize bad results, lie about
something important to the other person(s) and arrange to be caught in
the lie in such a way as to produce maximum shock. Additional stress points
awarded for keeping the lie going for a while before discovery, which increases
the disorientation and sense of betrayal in the deceived person(s). Lying
about sex gets double points. Lying about being married gets triple f***-up
points. Creative lies of omission (i.e. "not telling") with fancy rationalizations
and condescension get gold stars.
<p>2. Avoid self-knowledge. This is more elegant than strategy 1, as it
combines a bold sweep of denial with sorties of distraction aimed at oneself.
This tactic is most effective when combined with tactics 3 and 4. Self-destructive
or addictive behaviour has also been found very effective in avoiding self-knowledge
by our researchers. When combined with an endearing attitude of helplessness,
this strategy has been proven efficacious in attracting "rescuers" or "white
knights" on whom one can then practice strategies 4 and 3, in that order.
<p>3. Blame the other person(s). If anything went wrong, hey, it must be
their fault, right? This eliminates the need for messy things like communication
and negotiation, which can be embarrassing, particularly if one is using
strategy 2.
<p>4. Disclaim responsibility. This is a little more complex than strategy
3, and often includes what is referred to as "codependency". The classic
way to play this strategy is to cater to the partner(s) involved while
repressing one's own desires and questions. This allows a good head of
resentment to build up, and one can justify anger by saying one has done
so <i>much</i> for one's partner(s) and gets no thanks, etc. In its most
refined state, this strategy makes the other person(s) responsible for
setting the direction, pace and content of the relationship, for which
one can them blame them if one's own expectations or needs are not met.
Using strategy 2 to avoid knowledge of these expectations and needs gets
double points.
<p>5. Push. This is an art, albeit a crude one. When augmented with strategy
6, pushing can achieve spectacular negative results in even a short time.
Remember, when pushing, only <i>your</i> satisfaction counts! It's a dog
eat dog world, and you're a pit bull. Emotional and mental bullying can
be as satisfying as old-fashioned physical coercion, and not nearly as
easily prosecutable.
<p>6. Play on insecurity. This is an old favorite. Using sexual insecurity
as a weapon and combining this with strategy 5 is a four-star winner. Attempting
to control one's partner(s) by manipulating them through their insecurities
is a sure-fire f***-up tactic. It's so much more delicate than simply beating
them up, too, though the resultant emotional damage can be remarkably similar.
<p>7. Avoid intimacy. This may seem paradoxical; after all, we're talking
about getting up-close and personal with as many hot bi babes -- er, ahem
-- we're discussing achieving satisfyingly close relationships with a number
of people, right? The trick of avoiding intimacy can be performed in several
ways, but the easiest is to confuse intimacy with "rubbing slippery bits
together." Substitute the words "sex" and "love" for each other often in
conversations. Repeat the mantra, "If you loved me, you'd know what I want."
Practice strategy 8 assiduously, supplementing it with strategy 2. According
to the needs of the moment, figure out whether action or words are more
likely to be ambiguous or misconstrued, and go with what gives you the
most plausible deniability later. Some exceptionally talented individuals
manage to give the impression of being intimate while successfully remaining
stone-cold. Study sales techniques for pointers. People with good "lines"
fall into this category, especially if the lines include explanations of
how they truly <i>value</i> the other person.
<p>8. Don't talk. Talking has been known to lead to communication if practiced
carelessly. Communication will seriously impair your f***-up progress,
and in certain cases will halt or reverse it entirely. If you <i>must</i>
talk, use cliches and quotations from popular songs as much as possible,
or fall back on strategy number 1.
<p>If all else fails, make a safer-sex agreement with your partner(s) and
then break it, contracting a communicable disease about which you do not
then tell them. Double points for avoiding all discussion or negotiation
of sexual matters entirely so that the "agreement" is wishful thinking
and completely deniable. For a coup de grace, add strategy 6 and tell them
it wouldn't have happened if they had been satisfying you like they were
supposed to.
<p>9. For the ultimate metaf***-up, remain technically faithful to your
partner while breaking the spirit of whatever agreement you have whenever
possible, keeping this knowledge bottled up to ensure maximum fear, shame
and resentment. Some people win the grand prize with the figleaf-and-stinging-nettle
cluster for self-inflicted suffering and wasted potential by managing to
keep this strategy up until death do them part, concealing from their spouse
the fact that they have been shamming happiness all these years.
