&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/technology/apple-timothy-cook-fbi-san-bernardino.html&#34;&gt;Apple versus FBI showdown&lt;/a&gt;
has quickly become
a crucial flashpoint of the
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailydot.com/politics/tim-cook-encryption-iphone-hero-businessman/&#34;&gt;new Crypto War&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
On February 16 the FBI invoked
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/19/preliminary-thoughts-on-the-apple-iphone-order-in-the-san-bernardino-case-part-2-the-all-writs-act/&#34;&gt;the All Writs Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt;,
a catch-all authority for assistance of law enforcement,
demanding that Apple create a custom version of its iOS
to help the FBI decrypt an iPhone used by one of the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/preparing-for-apocalypse-in-san-bernardino&#34;&gt;San Bernardino shooters&lt;/a&gt;.
The fact that the FBI allowed Apple to disclose the order publicly,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/&#34;&gt;on the same day&lt;/a&gt;,
represents a rare exception to the government&amp;rsquo;s normal penchant for secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind the FBI&amp;rsquo;s unusually loud entrance are important &amp;ndash;
but even more so is the risk that after the present flurry concludes,
the FBI and other government agencies will revert
to more shadowy methods of compelling companies to backdoor their software.
This blog post explores these software transparency risks,
and how &lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/witness-abs&#34;&gt;new technical measures&lt;/a&gt;
could help ensure that the public debate over software backdoors
&lt;em&gt;remains&lt;/em&gt; public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-decryption-assistance-order:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;The Decryption Assistance Order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple and other technology companies regularly comply with
government orders for data in their possession.
The controversial order&amp;rsquo;s key distinction, however,
is that the data is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in Apple&amp;rsquo;s posession but on an encrypted iPhone,
and the order requires Apple
to create &lt;em&gt;new software&lt;/em&gt; to help the FBI circumvent that iPhone&amp;rsquo;s security.
While Apple is probably &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/02/17/apple-can-comply-with-the-fbi-court-order/&#34;&gt;technically able to comply with the FBI&amp;rsquo;s order&lt;/a&gt;,
it is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cryptome.org/2016/02/usg-apple-016.pdf&#34;&gt;fighting the order&lt;/a&gt;
on the grounds that
&amp;ldquo;the government demands that Apple create a back door
to defeat the encryption on the iPhone,
making its users’ most confidential and personal information vulnerable
to hackers, identity thieves, hostile foreign agents,
and unwarranted government surveillance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed,
demanding that a private company
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=5645&#34;&gt;create a new forensic instrument&lt;/a&gt;
to the government&amp;rsquo;s order,
weakening the security of Apple&amp;rsquo;s own devices and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/02/apple_and_the_fbi_think_iphones_are_safes_a_philosopher_explains_what_they.single.html&#34;&gt;exposing their users&amp;rsquo; innermost secrets&lt;/a&gt;,
may
&lt;a href=&#34;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/fbis-case-against-apple-could-violate-free-speech&#34;&gt;violate the first amendment&lt;/a&gt;.
At any rate, the order is
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/technical-perspective-apple-iphone-case&#34;&gt;like asking General Motors to build a new truck
with a fifth wheel by next month.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI could probably create their own backdoored version of iOS.
However, Apple&amp;rsquo;s devices accept only software updates digitally
signed with a secret key
that presumably only Apple controls.
&lt;em&gt;Presumably&lt;/em&gt;.  We&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-all-the-publicity:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;Why All the Publicity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting and unusual features of this particular case
is how quickly we, the public,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/&#34;&gt;learned about it from Apple&lt;/a&gt;.
The FBI could have quietly delivered this order under seal,
as it has done with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-seeks-to-force-apple-to-extract-data-from-about-12-other-iphones-1456202213&#34;&gt;similar decryption-assistance demands to Apple&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash;
as well as to other companies
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-lavabit-melted-down[&#34;&gt;such as Lavabit&lt;/a&gt;,
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email&#34;&gt;now-defunct&lt;/a&gt; E-mail provider that Edward Snowden used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/technology/how-tim-cook-became-a-bulwark-for-digital-privacy.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&#34;&gt;reportedly requested that the FBI&amp;rsquo;s order be sealed&lt;/a&gt;,
but the FBI wanted the public showdown.
The facts of the case &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160220/22412933661/no-fbi-does-not-need-info-farooks-iphone-this-is-entirely-about-precedent.shtml&#34;&gt;undermine the FBI&amp;rsquo;s claims&lt;/a&gt;
of urgently needing this iPhone&amp;rsquo;s contents:
the killers were already long dead,
the mountain of metadata the FBI already had about the killers
revealed no hint of connections to other terrorists,
and the iPhone in question was an employer-provided work phone
that the killers did not bother to destroy
as they did their two personal phones.
The Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor interpretation of the facts suggest
that the FBI is far less interested in the data itself
than in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macworld.com/article/3034355/ios/why-the-fbis-request-to-apple-will-affect-civil-rights-for-a-generation.html&#34;&gt;the court precedent&lt;/a&gt;
a legal win would establish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it appears the FBI is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@thegrugq/feeble-noise-pollution-627acb5931a2#.nv513bwae&#34;&gt;playing politics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
via a
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple?CMP=twt_gu&#34;&gt;carefully planned legal battle&amp;hellip;months in the making.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
The iPhone in question represents a strategically-chosen battleground
on which the FBI thinks it can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bgr.com/2016/02/17/fbi-vs-apple-smartphone-encryption/&#34;&gt;win using the terrorism card&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash;
even if this particular iPhone in fact has
&lt;a href=&#34;https://theintercept.com/2016/02/26/farooks-iphone-is-probably-useless-even-the-police-say-so/&#34;&gt;little or no intelligence value&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lining up in Apple&amp;rsquo;s defense are

including Google, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, and Amazon;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-secrecy-alternative-past-and-future:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;The Secrecy Alternative, Past and Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important as this public battle is,
the FBI and governments around the world
can and often have pursued the same goals in secret:
Apple versus FBI is more the exception than the rule.
Recall the result of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newamerica.org/oti/doomed-to-repeat-history-lessons-from-the-crypto-wars-of-the-1990s/&#34;&gt;the first Crypto Wars&lt;/a&gt;,
in which the US government attempted to mandate
key escrow encryption embodied in the infamous
&lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/what-the-government-shouldve-learned-about-backdoors-from-the-clipper-chip/&#34;&gt;Clipper Chip&lt;/a&gt;.
While the government lost that public battle,
they did not give up but merely
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;shifted their efforts to compromise encryption back into the shadows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the NSA apparently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lawfareblog.com/nsas-subversion-nists-algorithm&#34;&gt;slipped a backdoor into a NIST standard for random number generation&lt;/a&gt;,
allowing the holder of a secret
to compromise all cryptographic algorithms on a device.
Demonstrating the perils of trying to keep a backdoor
accessible only to &amp;ldquo;the good guys,&amp;rdquo;
an unknown attacker recently managed to &amp;ldquo;re-key&amp;rdquo;
and take over a latent copy of this backdoored random number generator
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/12/researchers-solve-the-juniper-mystery-and-they-say-its-partially-the-nsas-fault/&#34;&gt;in Juniper Networks routers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if sanity prevails in this new round of the Crypto Wars,
we can count on continued attempts by the US and governments around the world
to aquire secret backdoors.
Governments can of course
exploit &lt;a href=&#34;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/apple-fbi-should-ask-the-nsa-to-hack-shooters-iphone&#34;&gt;software bugs&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-04/who-needs-apple-when-the-fbi-could-hack-terrorist-iphone-itself&#34;&gt;physical vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;
to break into personal devices,
but secret backdoors will remain an attractive Siren song.
It is easier, cheaper, and less risky to exploit a known backdoor
than to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/dwallach/apple-the-fbi-and-the-san-bernadino-iphone/&#34;&gt;reach into the treasure chest and engineer a custom exploit&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-software-update-backdoor:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;The Software Update Backdoor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of today&amp;rsquo;s personal devices, including Apple&amp;rsquo;s,
already have a ready-made &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; ripe for exploitation,
in the form of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/most-software-already-has-a-golden-key-backdoor-its-called-auto-update/&#34;&gt;automatic software updates validated by digital signatures&lt;/a&gt;.
One way the US government could
aquire a universal backdoor to Apple&amp;rsquo;s devices is
simply by demanding a copy of Apple&amp;rsquo;s secret software signing keys.
The government already showed a willingness to do exactly this,
in demanding the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-lavabit-melted-down&#34;&gt;master keys to Lavabit&amp;rsquo;s encrypted E-mail service&lt;/a&gt;
while investigating Snowden.
This might not be entirely trivial if Apple&amp;rsquo;s software signing keys
are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thawte.com/code-signing/whitepaper/best-practices-for-code-signing-certificates.pdf&#34;&gt;held in hardware security modules&lt;/a&gt;
designed to thwart the extraction or cloning of secret keys.
In that case, however, the government could still simply
demand that Apple use its secret key to produce a valid digital signature
for the FBI&amp;rsquo;s backdoored version of iOS,
while keeping this process
and the existence of this backdoored iOS secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Apple wins this public battle, therefore,
they will still face well-founded post-Snowden fears and suspicions &amp;ndash;
from companies and governments around the world &amp;ndash;
as to whether Apple can be coerced into
secretly helping to sign backdoored software and firmware images.
This risk is by no means specific to Apple,
but faced by &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; organization that creates and releases software.
Even open source software is not immune,
because you cannot be certain whether a software update
represents a correctly-compiled or backdoored version of a source release
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34;&gt;unless you build it yourself&lt;/a&gt;,
which precious few users do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;software-transparency-via-decentralized-witness-cosigning:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;Software Transparency via Decentralized Witness Cosigning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2016/&#34;&gt;IEEE Security &amp;amp; Privacy 2016&lt;/a&gt;
we will present a paper
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/witness-abs&#34;&gt;preliminary draft available here&lt;/a&gt;)
introducing &lt;em&gt;decentralized witness cosigning&lt;/em&gt;,
a technological means by software makers such as Apple
could protect their users
from secretly backdoored versions of their software &amp;ndash;
and in turn protect &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; and their financial bottom lines from
worldwide fears and suspicions about the possibility of backdoored software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With conventional digital signatures,
as currently used for most software and firmware signing processes,
a single party (e.g., Apple) holds the secret key
needed to produce valid software images
that devices and their software update systems will accept.
Any well-designed update system refuses to accept any software image
unless it has been authenticated using a &lt;em&gt;digital certificate&lt;/em&gt;
embedded in the device,
which cryptographically identifies the software maker
via a mathematical relationship with the secret signing key.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thawte.com/code-signing/whitepaper/best-practices-for-code-signing-certificates.pdf&#34;&gt;Best practices for software signing&lt;/a&gt;
are already
to keep particularly sensitive signing keys offline,
perhaps in HSMs or even split across multiple HSMs,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/28/seven-people-keys-worldwide-internet-security-web&#34;&gt;as ICANN does&lt;/a&gt;
in its ornate
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudflare.com/dnssec/root-signing-ceremony/&#34;&gt;DNSSEC key signing ceremony&lt;/a&gt;.
But as noted above,
such measures do not prevent the &lt;em&gt;organization&lt;/em&gt; from being coerced
into secret misuse of these signing keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With decentralized witness cosigning,
a software maker imprints their devices and software update systems
with a digital certificate corresponding not just to their own secret key
but also to secret keys held by a group of independent &lt;em&gt;witnesses&lt;/em&gt;.
These witnesses might include other cooperating software companies,
public-interest organizations such as ALCU, EFF, or CDT,
or major corporate customers or governments around the world
desiring not just verbal but also technological assurances
of the software maker&amp;rsquo;s commitment to transparency.
In turn, before accepting any software image
the device&amp;rsquo;s update system verifies that it has been signed
not only by the software maker but also by a threshold number
of the designated witnesses.
In essence, the device does not accept any software image
unless it arrives with a cryptographic &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo;
that this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; software image has been publicly observed by &amp;ndash;
and thereby placed under the scrutiny of &amp;ndash;
a decentralized group of independent parties scattered around the world
in different jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scalability-of-witness-cosigning:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;The Scalability of Witness Cosigning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, it is quite easy to implement witness cosigning
if the number of witnesses is small.
A software maker could simply gather a list of individual signatures
for each new software release,
in much the same way people have handled
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ecssba.rutgers.edu/docs/petuniv.html&#34;&gt;public petitions&lt;/a&gt;
for hundreds of years.
If we want the group of witnesses to be large, however &amp;ndash;
and we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, to ensure that compromising transparency would
require not just a few but hundreds or even thousands of witnesses
to be colluding maliciously &amp;ndash;
then gathering hundreds or thousands of individual signatures
for each software release could become painful and inefficient.
Worse, every device needing to validate a software download or update
would need to check all these signatures individually,
causing delays and consuming battery power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key technical contribution of our research is a distributed protocol
that automates this process and
makes large, decentralized witness cosigning groups practical.
I will spare you the details, but those interested can
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/witness-abs&#34;&gt;find them here&lt;/a&gt;.
The oversimplified summary is that the protocol involves compressing
hundreds or thousands of signatures into a single one
that can be verified almost as simply and efficiently
verifying a normal individual signature.
For illustration,
a traditional many-signature petition handled this way might look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;multisig.svg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;What a classic petition would look like as a cryptographic multisignature&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Superposing standard pencil-and-paper signatures this way
would of course offer little or no security,
but such superposition &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be made secure with modern digital signatures.
This is one of the remarkable properties of modern cryptography,
and is a well-understood property that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.bu.edu/~reyzin/multisig.html&#34;&gt;long predates our work&lt;/a&gt;.
Again, our main contribution is to make witness cosigning scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-anyone-know-if-there-s-a-backdoor:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;How Does Anyone Know If There&amp;rsquo;s a Backdoor?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,
independent witnesses cannot necessarily determine immediately,
during the witness cosigning process,
whether or not a particular software image actually contains a backdoor.
This is especially true in the common case where the source code is proprietary
and the software maker signs and releases only binary images.
Nevertheless, the witnesses can still proactively ensure &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt;
by ensuring that
&lt;em&gt;every correctly-signed software image in existence&lt;/em&gt;
has been disclosed, cataloged, and made subject to public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if future Apple devices adopted decentralized witness cosigning,
and a government attempted to coerce Apple secretly into signing
a backdoored version of iOS version 11.2.1,
then the only way Apple could do so would be to submit
the backdoored iOS version to the independent witnesses for cosigning.
Even though those witnesses could not necessarily recognize the backdoor,
they could immediately notice that two different iOS images
labeled &amp;ldquo;version 11.2.1&amp;rdquo; have been signed:
the standard one and the backdoored one.
This inconsistency alone should
immediately raise alarms and draw the attention of security companies
around the world, who could carefully inspect
the differences between the two software images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government could of course coerce Apple to give the backdoored image
a different version number that most of their customers never receive:
e.g., &amp;ldquo;11.2.1fbi&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;
or a more anonymous &amp;ldquo;11.2.1.1.&amp;rdquo;
However, the witnesses would still be able to tell that an iOS image &lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt;
that has been signed but not widely distributed,
again likely drawing suspicion and careful scrutiny by security experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Apple &amp;ndash; or a malicious Apple employee &amp;ndash;
could still slip a subtle backdoor or security &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo;
into the standard iOS releases that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; runs.
Accidental bugs and backdoors alike can persist for years without being noticed,
as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/12/researchers-solve-the-juniper-mystery-and-they-say-its-partially-the-nsas-fault/&#34;&gt;the Juniper incident&lt;/a&gt;
amply demonstrates.
Open source software offers a transparency advantage,
especially with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34;&gt;reproducible builds&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash;
but even source-level backdoors can be
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.underhanded-c.org/&#34;&gt;devilishly&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://underhandedcrypto.com/&#34;&gt;tricky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless,
techniques and tools for analysing both source and binary software
is constantly improving,
and decentralized witness cosigning can ensure that
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; releases of a software distribution are publicly known
and exposed to this analysis by talented security researchers
and white-hat hackers
around the world.
An attacker who slips a backdoor into a public software release
inherently faces a risk that the backdoor could be discovered at any time.
Witness cosigning prevents attackers from sidestepping that risk of discovery,
even by secretly deploying the backdoored software only on targeted devices
under attacker-controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;proactive-versus-retroactive-transparency-approaches:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;Proactive versus Retroactive Transparency Approaches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralized witness cosigning is by no means the first
cryptographic transparency mechanism.
For example, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
used to secure Web connections
&lt;a href=&#34;http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-exploits-digital-certificates/&#34;&gt;similar weaknesses&lt;/a&gt; similar to software update systems.
PKI transparency mechanisms such as
&lt;a href=&#34;http://convergence.io&#34;&gt;Convergence&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/sovereign-keys&#34;&gt;Sovereign Keys&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.certificate-transparency.org&#34;&gt;Certificate Transparency&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xia/resources/Documents/kim-www13.pdf&#34;&gt;AKI&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xia/resources/Documents/basin_ccs14.pdf&#34;&gt;ARPKI&lt;/a&gt;
chip away at this problem.
Certificate Transparency is now
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.certificate-transparency.org/certificate-transparency-in-chrome&#34;&gt;standard in the Chrome browser&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2660311&#34;&gt;Application Transparency&lt;/a&gt;
is a proposed variant of Certificate Transparency
adapted to software downloads and updates.
Related proposals such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~perspectives/perspectives_usenix08.pdf&#34;&gt;Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coniks.org&#34;&gt;CONIKS&lt;/a&gt;
address closely-related problems for Secure Shell (SSH) connections
and end-to-end encrypted messaging, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These prior transparency mechanisms have two crucial weaknesses, however:
they do not significantly increase the number of secret keys
an attacker must control to compromise any personal device,
and personal devices cannot even retroactively detect such compromise
unless they can actively communicate with multiple well-known Internet servers.
For example, even with Certificate Transparency,
an attacker can forge an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.certificate-transparency.org/ev-ct-plan&#34;&gt;Extended Validation (EV) certificate for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;
after compromising or coercing only three parties:
one Certificate Authority (CA) and
two &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.certificate-transparency.org/known-logs&#34;&gt;log servers&lt;/a&gt;.
Since many CAs and log servers are in US jurisdiction,
such an attack is clearly within reach of the US government.
If such an attack does occur,
Certificate Transparency cannot detect it unless
the victim device has a chance to communicate or &lt;em&gt;gossip&lt;/em&gt;
the fake certificate
with other parties on the Internet &amp;ndash;
after it has already accepted and started
using the fake digital certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gossip-mechanisms-can-t-guarantee-software-transparency:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;Gossip Mechanisms Can&amp;rsquo;t Guarantee Software Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These weaknesses are especially severe
in the domain of software transparency,
the central issue in the Apple versus FBI case.
First, if a personal device accepts and starts running
a backdoored software update
before the device has had a chance to gossip
information about the update with other parties on the Internet,
then the backdoored software can evade transparency
simply by disabling gossip in the updated code.
Second, even if for some reason the attacker
cannot or neglects to take this obvious step,
the attacker can still evade transparency by controlling
either the device or its Internet access paths.
In the FBI versus Apple case, for example,
the FBI could trivially evade gossip-based transparency,
and keep its backdoored iOS image secret,
by keeping the device disconnected from the rest of the Internet
after installing their backdoored software update.
(They probably plan to anyway,
to ensure that no &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/san-bernardino-da-baffles-security-community-lying-dormant-cyber-pathogen-iphone&#34;&gt;cyber pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; escape.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weakness of gossip-based transparency
also applies to attackers who may not control the device itself
but control the device&amp;rsquo;s Internet access path.
For example, a compromised Internet service provider (ISP)
or corporate Internet gateway can defeat gossip-based transparency
by persistently blocking a victim&amp;rsquo;s access
to transparency servers elsewhere on the Internet.
Even if the user&amp;rsquo;s device is mobile,
a state intelligence service such as China&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/25/asia/china-war-internet-great-firewall/&#34;&gt;Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
could defeat gossip-based transparency by persistently blocking
connections from a targeted victim&amp;rsquo;s devices to global transparency servers,
in the same way that China already blocks connections to many websites
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/china&#34;&gt;to the Tor anonymity network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:daca22b8e12080abaf8bf3354448169b&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noisy Apple versus FBI battle is merely the visible tip
of a looming software integrity iceberg,
illustrating both the importance of software transparency mechanisms
and the technical challenges in securing them.
Current gossip-based methods
cannot actually guarantee transparency
if an attacker is in control of the target device or its Internet access path,
as in the current FBI versus Apple scenario.
Even if software updates were guarded by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.certificate-transparency.org/&#34;&gt;Certificate Transparency&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2660311&#34;&gt;Application Transparency&lt;/a&gt;,
the FBI could still secretly force Apple
to sign a backdoored software update,
coerce two US-based log cervers to sign fake log entries
while keeping both the software update and the fake logs secret,
and isolating the targeted device offline
so that it cannot gossip the fake update metadata with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralized witness cosigning is currently the only known method
of ensuring transparency and public accountability in such situations.
Taking a proactive approach,
witness cosigning provides devices with a standalone cryptographic proof
that a software update has been observed by many independent parties,
&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the device accepts or runs the software.
In this way,
companies such as Apple could offer their customers
a strong guarantee
that every valid software image in existence has been publicly disclosed
before any of their devices, anywhere, will consider it valid &amp;ndash;
even if the device and/or its network
is controlled by an attacker who does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
exhibit the FBI&amp;rsquo;s fleeting taste for publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present public debate over backdoors in personal devices
is of critical importance to our security, privacy, and personal freedom.
But equally important is ensuring that this time
the debate &lt;em&gt;stays&lt;/em&gt; public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An abstract group arithmetic framework for public-key cryptography
based on the discrete logarithm problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several alternative concrete instantiations of this abstract
group arithmetic framework,
based on the NIST elliptic curve implementations in the Go standard library
and in the OpenSSL crypto library,
and implementations of both generic Edwards curves
and an adaptation of Adam Langley&amp;rsquo;s Ed25519-curve-specific
optimized group arithmetic code to the abstract group API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementations of a number of advanced crypto algorithms
built on this abstract group arithmetic framework,
and hence automatically compatible woth both integer group
and any suitable elliptic curves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shamir Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS),
the standard foundation for t-of-n threshold cryptographic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An implementation of the general Camenisch/Stadler framework
for proofs of knowledge based on the discrete-logarithm problem.
For example&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anonymous and pseudonymous public-key encryption and signatures,
where the sender or receiver are identified only as an anonymous member
of some explicit &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; of public keys, without revealing anything
about which member of the set signed the message or is to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. Andrew Neff&amp;rsquo;s cryptographic protocol for proving
the correctness of a shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;page-title:7d8de8e35d448be369b4641e7d346cee&#34;&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge there are currently only two fundamentally distinct approaches
to achieving strong anonymity online,
and the same legendary computing figure, David Chaum,
pioneered both.
His first approach,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/chaum-mix.pdf&#34;&gt;mixes&lt;/a&gt;,
relay messages over multi-hop paths around the network
to obscure their source and destinations.
State-of-the-art deployed anonymity systems such as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;
are highly evolved and performance-optimized variants
of this basic relaying idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaum&amp;rsquo;s second approach,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/chaum-dc.pdf&#34;&gt;dining cryptographers&lt;/a&gt;,
instead uses information-coding principles to hide the sender of a message
among a group of nodes all of whom seem to be spewing gibberish at once.
It&amp;rsquo;s as if you are listening to a crowd
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.christianpublishers.org/Speaking%20in%20Tongues-1.jpg&#34;&gt;speaking in tongues&lt;/a&gt;
but what you hear is a single unified voice,
emanating from no one in particular,
elucidating the Ten Commandments with perfect clarity.
Chaum then moved away from anonymity systems
to other projects such as the first major attempt at practical electronic cash
(yes, he was also the &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; Satoshi Nakamoto),
and secure electronic voting systems.
While several research projects,
including Cornell&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/herbivore/&#34;&gt;Herbivore&lt;/a&gt;
and my own
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/&#34;&gt;Dissent&lt;/a&gt;
have made progress toward making the dining cryptographers practical,
it has not (yet) made it into widely-deployed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Chaum&amp;rsquo;s status as &amp;ldquo;the father of online anonymity&amp;rdquo;,
it stands to reason
that his first venture &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; into anonymity in many years
would get some attention.
Today at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realworldcrypto.com/rwc2016&#34;&gt;Real World Crypto&lt;/a&gt;,
he presented
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/008.pdf&#34;&gt;cMix&lt;/a&gt;,
an interesting new take on the mix approach
that aims to achieve better scalability, lower latencies,
and sufficiently low computation costs on client devices
to be practical for use in energy-conscious mobile phone apps.
I had the pleasure of learning about cMix directly from David
and discussing it with him at some length last year,
but my recent move to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epfl.ch/&#34;&gt;EPFL&lt;/a&gt; and other time demands
prevented me from being able to take a more active role in the project.
The design of cMix is definitely interesting and contains some promising ideas,
but that is not what this blog post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ending-the-crypto-war-or-stoking-the-flames:7d8de8e35d448be369b4641e7d346cee&#34;&gt;Ending the Crypto War, or Stoking the Flames?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier today before Chaum&amp;rsquo;s talk, Wired also released
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2016/01/david-chaum-father-of-online-anonymity-plan-to-end-the-crypto-wars/&#34;&gt;an article on it&lt;/a&gt;
containing a statement that will doubtless attract
a lot more attention than anything in the technical paper on cMix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Chaum is also building into PrivaTegrity another feature that’s sure to be far more controversial: a carefully controlled backdoor that allows anyone doing something “generally recognized as evil” to have their anonymity and privacy stripped altogether.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well before Chaum&amp;rsquo;s talk even began,
Twitter was ablaze with discussion about Chaum&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; in PrivaTegrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The main benefit of Chaum&amp;#39;s new system, as far as I can tell, is that it is a political gift to FBI Director Comey. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/64Au0lXxuL&#34;&gt;https://t.co/64Au0lXxuL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/684730483503149056&#34;&gt;January 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m heartbroken to see that Chaum is proposing key escrow for everyone on the planet: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/zWZ3bUQsJf&#34;&gt;https://t.co/zWZ3bUQsJf&lt;/a&gt; What happened to David Chaum?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/684763375260270592&#34;&gt;January 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-where-s-the-backdoor:7d8de8e35d448be369b4641e7d346cee&#34;&gt;But Where&amp;rsquo;s the Backdoor?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important observation, however, is that the word &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo;
appears nowhere in the actual
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/008.pdf&#34;&gt;technical paper on cMix&lt;/a&gt; written by
Chaum and his collaborators.
While cMix is the anonymous communication protocol Chaum is proposing,
PrivaTegrity is a larger system built on cMix
to provide anonymous chat and other anonymous interaction applications
directly usable to ordinary users.
In essence, cMix is just an &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo; whereas PrivaTegrity is the car.
So where is this supposed &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; &amp;emdash; in the engine or the car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only part of the technical cMix paper that even suggests
the &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; idea (without using that term)
is section IX.B., two brief paragraphs on the paper&amp;rsquo;s second-to-last page.
The first is the most crucial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Independent from cMix, PrivaTegrity addresses potential
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;abuse of anonymity services by establishing a trust model
that offers a balance of anonymity and accountability. On the
one hand, PrivaTegrity aims to provide privacy at a technical
level that is not penetrable by nation states. On the other
hand, PrivaTegrity aims to provide integrity, both prior restraint
and accountability after the fact, that is inescapably tied to
individuals. Only if all of the mixing nodes cooperate, can the
senders and receivers of messages be linked or identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, cMix routes users&amp;rsquo; messages through a series of mixing nodes
(the Wired article talks about nine servers in different countries),
such that none of the servers can individually unmask an anonymous user,
but all of the servers (or their operators) together can unmask a user
that they collectively agree to be deserving of such treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This property is by no means new, unusual, or unique to cMix, however:
in fact a huge number of cryptographic and distributed systems
have this essential security property.
No one really knows how to build secure systems
in which you need to trust &lt;em&gt;no one at all&lt;/em&gt;.
Instead the best we can really do is to &lt;em&gt;split&lt;/em&gt; trust across multiple entities
that we hope are at least somewhat independent,
so that no one entity needs to be fully trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the same security principle that motivates
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deansafe.com/uncodrsawisa.html&#34;&gt;safes with two keys&lt;/a&gt;.
If both keys are required to open the safe and are held by different employees,
then a single dishonest employee working alone will be unable to raid it
without somehow aquiring the other key.
But if the two key-holders conspire,
the two-key mechanism will do nothing to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trust-splitting-in-anonymity-systems:7d8de8e35d448be369b4641e7d346cee&#34;&gt;Trust Splitting in Anonymity Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially all of the practical anonymity systems,
both deployed and proposed in research,
embody this limited trust-splitting property in some fashion.
Several years ago my group
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/eurosec12-abs&#34;&gt;coined the term &amp;ldquo;anytrust&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
for this security model in the context of anonymity systems,
because users need only assume that &amp;ldquo;any one&amp;rdquo; of the servers is honest
and not colluding with all the others against them.
Users don&amp;rsquo;t even need to know or guess which server is honest;
one merely &lt;em&gt;needs to exist&lt;/em&gt;.
Once again, we did not by any means invent this security model;
it has been in use in many ways and under many names for decades
in cryptography and distributed systems practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of the well-known &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; anonymity system,
for example,
depend for their security on a small group of
&lt;em&gt;directory authorities&lt;/em&gt; &amp;emdash;
of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kristovatlas/status/684845884576796673&#34;&gt;there are currently 10&lt;/a&gt; &amp;emdash;
to keep track of and let Tor clients know the set of relays
available to help anonymize their messages.
If &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PrivaTegrity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is Chaum&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;backdoor&amp;rdquo; a technical feature?
no, just a common architectural weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tor has it&amp;hellip; (examples)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we eliminate such trusted server groups?  Yes, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does CT fix it?  Not quite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy question: are backdoors needed/good in an anonymity systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would the processes be for controlled deanonymization of a user,
supposing one created a system and set it up like Chaum&amp;rsquo;s
on the (policy) basis that server operators would cooperate
to deanonymize users under &amp;ldquo;the right conditions&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who picks those 9 server operators?  Who funds them?
(The power of the purse is strong&amp;hellip;)
If a nation-state comes to them and says,
&amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ll block your service and thus destroy a big part of your legal business
unless you help us deanonymize these people who we call &amp;lsquo;terrorists&amp;rsquo;
but the rest of the world calls &amp;lsquo;political dissidents&amp;rsquo;&amp;ldquo;,
what do they do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sybil problem, multiple possible levels of response&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday the

together with a &amp;ldquo;Nameless Coalition&amp;rdquo; of like-minded groups,

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-facebook-about-its-real-names-policy&#34;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;
urging Facebook to end this policy
like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/07/17/google_plus_finally_ditches_its_ineffective_dangerous_real_name_policy.html&#34;&gt;Google Plus did last year&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/nameless-coalition-petitions-facebook-to-rethink-its-real-name-policy&#34;&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s response&lt;/a&gt;
cites concerns about pseudonyms helping to hide
&amp;ldquo;terrorist organizations&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;school bullies&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;criminal behavior.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I support anonymity and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/10/192387-seeking-anonymity-in-an-internet-panopticon/fulltext&#34;&gt;have spent years working to strengthen it&lt;/a&gt;,
terrorist fearmongering aside,
Facebook is right that anonymity is often abused.
Pseudonym-friendly Twitter constantly
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/04/twitter-abuse/&#34;&gt;struggles with trolls&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win/&#34;&gt;has&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/27/twitter-trolls-threats-bank-notes-austen&#34;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mashable.com/2012/11/09/twitter-sports-trolls/#_0rIFtoO8gqI&#34;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;.
Ironically, such abuse has even
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/03/privacy-advocates-unmask-twitter-troll&#34;&gt;led die-hard anonymity advocates to
de-anonymize trolls&lt;/a&gt;.
And even Twitter&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/03/hey-twitter-killing-anonymitys-dumb-way-fight-trolls/&#34;&gt;demands for phone number verification&lt;/a&gt;
rankle users desiring the stronger anonymity provided by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org&#34;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;.
Online services seemingly face a zero-sum choice
between protecting people who have legitimate needs for anonymity,
and protecting everyone else from those who abuse anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a false choice,
because most of an abuser&amp;rsquo;s power comes not from having &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; pseudonym,
but from having &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;.
Abuse using an army of fake identities is known as
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/wikipedia-sockpuppet-investigation-largest-network-history-wiki-pr/&#34;&gt;sockpuppetry on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;,
or in computer science as a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com:8082/pubs/74220/IPTPS2002.pdf&#34;&gt;Sybil attack&lt;/a&gt;
after a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_(book)&#34;&gt;famous psychiatric case&lt;/a&gt;.
The security benefit Facebook arguably derives
from asking suspect users to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/319547548123767&#34;&gt;confirm their identity&lt;/a&gt;
has little to do with actually knowing the user&amp;rsquo;s real name:
is Facebook going to decide that an &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rdquo; is more trustworthy than a &amp;ldquo;Bob&amp;rdquo;?
On the contrary, the perceived security benefit
has everything to do with verifying that the user is a real &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;
controlling only that one account.
But what if online services could verify that a user is a real &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;
without intrusively demanding to know the user&amp;rsquo;s real &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pseudonym-parties:fe23a20afac7e671a2c3615c89cb68a9&#34;&gt;Pseudonym Parties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago I
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bford.info/pub/net/sybil.pdf&#34;&gt;proposed a possible solution&lt;/a&gt;
that I believe a determined group of activists like the Nameless Coalition
could readily put into practice on a grassroots budget
and with only minimal buy-in from industry.
The idea is simple:
Once a year, organizers in participating cities and towns host an event
to which anyone may show up in person and obtain a cryptographic token,
which might be simply a random-looking number printed on a slip of paper.
This token carries no identity information whatsoever,
but merely attests that the holder is a &lt;em&gt;real person&lt;/em&gt;.
The holder can subsequently use this token
to register or confirm pseudonymous accounts
with participating online services throughout the subsequent year.
Pseudonym party attendees need not show any ID,
and would even be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Venice&#34;&gt;welcome to wear masks&lt;/a&gt;,
but everyone would receive an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_ink&#34;&gt;indelible ink mark&lt;/a&gt;
making it difficult for cheaters to acquire several tokens the same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each token enables the holder to register pseudonymous accounts
at many online services,
but &lt;em&gt;only one account&lt;/em&gt; per service.
If the user abuses this one account, the service can shut it down,
and be assured that the abuser will be unable to obtain
another token-verified account until next year.
The main amplication power of anonymous abuse,
through Sybil attacks or sockpuppetry,
would be neutralized without the online service
having to know anything else about the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-people-not-real-names:fe23a20afac7e671a2c3615c89cb68a9&#34;&gt;Real People, Not Real Names&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokens distributed at pseudonym parties
would effectively enable online services to verify
that users are real people without verifying their real names.
For example, Facebook could add token-based verification
as a fourth alternative to their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/help/159096464162185&#34;&gt;three current ID-based verification options&lt;/a&gt;.
Would they?
That&amp;rsquo;s up to Facebook, but even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t,
other online services might do so as a way to
compete by presenting a more privacy-friendly image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least for now,
there is no reason to expect that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; should be expected
to attend pseudonym parties and obtain tokens each year,
only users who particularly care about their privacy
or have specific need for an alternative
to ID-based account verification.
As a result, the costs of organizing pseudonym parties
should start small, grow gradually with user demand,
and remain within the reach of nonprofit, donation-funded budgets.
Pseudonym party locations would initially be few and far between,
but would also serve as opportunities to organize, celebrate, and meet
other privacy-minded people in the region.
If the idea were successful and proved sustainable
in a few cities,
and even just a few privacy-minded online services
decided to support account verification via tokens,
this would help build critical mass to open more locations
and pressure other online services
to support ID-free account verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nameless Coalition is absolutely right to critique
Facebook&amp;rsquo;s real names policy and the problems it creates
for more vulnerable and privacy-sensitive users.
But the Coalition should also acknowledge the difficult tradeoffs
&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; online services currently face
between protecting their users&amp;rsquo; privacy
and protecting their users from anonymous abuse.
Instead of treating this problem as a zero-sum cultural tug-of-war,
we must give online services a means to verify
that users are real people without having to check their real names &amp;mdash;
and we should not wait for industry or government to take the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delegative Democracy Revisited</title>
      <link>http://bford.github.io/2014/11/16/deleg.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bford.github.io/2014/11/16/deleg.html</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Over a decade ago I wrote up some ideas
I called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/&#34;&gt;Delegative Democracy&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo;
which has also become known as
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://p2pfoundation.net/Liquid_Democracy&#34;&gt;Liquid Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
My &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/deleg.pdf&#34;&gt;draft paper from 2002&lt;/a&gt;
took a first stab at laying out the general idea,
though I never finished or tried to publish it.
Since a lot has happened in this space since then,
and I get regular inquiries about it,
I thought it was high time to revisit the idea
and review more recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-basic-idea:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;The Basic Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people including myself like the participatory ideal embodied in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy&#34;&gt;direct democracy&lt;/a&gt;,
but this ideal does not readily scale beyond small communities.
As I will shortly be moving to &lt;a href=&#34;http://epfl.ch&#34;&gt;EPFL&lt;/a&gt;,
I look forward to learning first-hand
how the Swiss make direct democracy work for them &amp;mdash;
but Switzerland is a small country divided into even smaller,
fairly autonomous cantons.
A basic criticism of direct democracy is that
expecting that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; eligible voter to
attend &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the meetings and keep up with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the issues,
rather than actually getting more people involved,
may instead disenfranchise those without infinite spare time or patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delegative democracy attempts to make direct democracy scale,
by allowing anyone who cannot participate directly in a particular vote
to &lt;em&gt;delegate&lt;/em&gt; their vote to someone they trust
to participate and vote on their behalf.
This process may be viewed as a mechanized equivalent
of seeking advice from a friend and voting based on that advice.
Delegative democracy differs from representative democracy
in the principle that each voter should have free, &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;
choice of their delegate &amp;mdash;
not just a choice among a restricted set of career politicians &amp;mdash;
just as we already make a free, individual choice of our friends.
Further, voters may choose to participate in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; meetings directly,
overriding their delegate&amp;rsquo;s choices in those meetings,
and voters may revoke or change their delegation at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While corporate governance practice often allows the related idea of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting&#34;&gt;proxy voting&lt;/a&gt;,
a proxy vote often amounts to a &amp;ldquo;pre-packaged mandate&amp;rdquo;:
e.g., a directive to cast an unconditional YES or NO vote on my behalf
regardless of what new information might be presented at the meeting
or what discussion might ensue.
The spirit of delegative democracy is closer to representative democracy,
in that delegation is not about delivering my &amp;ldquo;canned decision&amp;rdquo;
but about asking my trusted delegate to &lt;em&gt;participate&lt;/em&gt;
in the full deliberative process on my behalf.
My delegate can and is expected to listen and engage in the debate,
consider the information available,
and make what his views as the best decision on that basis.
If I dislike his decision,
I can choose a different delegate before the next vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins-of-the-idea:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Origins of the Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly,
I was only one of many people to think along these lines over the decades.
In Lewis Carrol&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCovAAAAYAAJ&#34;&gt;Principles of Parliamentary Representation&lt;/a&gt;
of 1884,
candidates could &amp;ldquo;club&amp;rdquo; their votes together,
allowing a candidate who received more votes than required to win a seat
to delegate the &amp;ldquo;excess&amp;rdquo; votes toward the election of other candidates.
James C. Miller in 1969 foresaw electronic voting and proposed a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01718736&#34;&gt;delegate proxy voting scheme&lt;/a&gt;,
to enable more widespread &amp;mdash; and more propoportional &amp;mdash;
representation in political decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting around 2002
the Internet exploded with reinventions
of this and similar ideas.
Besides my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brynosaurus.com/deleg/deleg.pdf&#34;&gt;Delegative Democracy&lt;/a&gt; proposal,
there was
Dennis Lomax&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20031220012108/www.beyondpolitics.org/Beyond_Politics_Intro.htm&#34;&gt;Beyond Politics&lt;/a&gt;,
Jio Ito&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/EmergentDemocracyPaper&#34;&gt;Emergent Democracy&lt;/a&gt;,
Sayke&amp;rsquo;s

dmatrix.com/wiki/python/LiquidDemocracy&#34;&gt;Liquid Democracy&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20040518131300/http://twistedmatrix.com/wiki/python/LiquidDemocracyVotingSystem&#34;&gt;voting system&lt;/a&gt;,
Mikael Nordfors&amp;rsquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/politics_Democracy2.1&#34;&gt;Democracy 2.1&lt;/a&gt;,
James Green-Armytage&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090528052745/http://fc.antioch.edu/~james_green-armytage/vm/proxy.htm&#34;&gt;delegable proxy system&lt;/a&gt;, and
Mark Rosst&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newciv.org/nl/newslog.php/_v45/__show_article/_a000009-000320.htm&#34;&gt;Structural Deep Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.
The idea of allowing voters to delegate their participation
to individually-chosen representatives
is central to all of these proposals, though details differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic-research:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Academic Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration of this idea in the academic literature has been more sparse,
no doubt in part because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to convince reviewers of the novelty
of an idea that&amp;rsquo;s been around in some form since the 1880s or 1960s,
depending on how you count.
However, Rodriguez et al&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://public.lanl.gov/jhw/Jen/Publications_files/Smarto-Share.pdf&#34;&gt;Smartocracy&lt;/a&gt;
develops a trust network and decision ranking algorithm
embodying a form of delegative democracy.
Paolo Boldi et al developed
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-kdd.isti.cnr.it/~bonchi/votingSN.pdf&#34;&gt;Viscous Democracy&lt;/a&gt;,
a transitive proxy voting algorithm
based on Google&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf&#34;&gt;PageRank&lt;/a&gt;
and in a vein similar to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sd-2/&#34;&gt;Structural Deep Democracy&lt;/a&gt;.
Wybo Wiersma explored the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wybowiersma.net/pub/AltFutures2013/Wiersma,Wybo,Transitive_delegative_democracy_through_Facebook.pdf&#34;&gt;integration of delegative democracy into social networking systems&lt;/a&gt; such as FaceBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking an economics perspective,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://inside.bard.edu/~armytage/research.html&#34;&gt;James Green-Armytage&lt;/a&gt;
has developed an
&lt;a href=&#34;http://inside.bard.edu/~armytage/proxy.pdf&#34;&gt;axiomatic model and analysis&lt;/a&gt;
of delegate proxy voting systems.
His work formally models the
&lt;em&gt;expressive loss&lt;/em&gt; of alternative voting systems &amp;mdash;
the collective decision-making &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; induced by voters who may have
limited information about issues and/or
limited choices of possible representatives.
This analysis mathematically confirms the intuition motivating
all the incarnations of delegative democracy:
namely, that &lt;em&gt;voluntary&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; choice of delegation
yields decisions with no more error (and most likely less)
than conventional alternatives such as direct or representative democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yefim Leifman has explored ways to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/351.pdf&#34;&gt;implement transitive delegation schemes
using cryptography&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a topic I am particularly interested in as well,
since a major motivation for my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/&#34;&gt;Dissent project&lt;/a&gt;
was to build practical anonymous communication systems
that would be good not only for &lt;em&gt;communication&lt;/em&gt;
but also for secure &lt;em&gt;deliberation&lt;/em&gt; mechanisms such as voting.
I hope more system-builders and security/privacy researchers
will be bold enough to venture into this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;delegative-liquid-democracy-in-the-real-world:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Delegative/Liquid Democracy in the Real World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing participation and engagement in political discourse
has long been a basic goal of many Internet democracy efforts.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://demoex.org&#34;&gt;Demoex&lt;/a&gt;,
an experiment to build political parties based on online direct democracy,
succeeded in Sweeden from 2002
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pernor.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;until this year&lt;/a&gt;,
as recounted in
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A414T9I&#34;&gt;The Little Horse from Athens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
by Per Norbäck.
While Demoex pursued something closer to traditional direct democracy,
it relied heavily on online participation
and made provision for voters to obtain voting advice from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most exciting development is that
starting around 2006,
free software organizations in Germany began building
two different software platforms for delegation-based
online discussion and deliberation:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://liquidfeedback.org&#34;&gt;LiquidFeedback&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://adhocracy.de&#34;&gt;Adhocracy&lt;/a&gt;.
LiquidFeedback was adopted and used for the past several years by the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_Germany&#34;&gt;German Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt;,
as recounted in an
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.liquid-democracy-journal.org/issue/1/The_Liquid_Democracy_Journal-Issue001-02-Five_years_of_Liquid_Democracy_in_Germany.html&#34;&gt;article by Björn Swierczek&lt;/a&gt;

Further information on these tools and their adoption is now available in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://principles.liquidfeedback.org&#34;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.liquid-democracy-journal.org&#34;&gt;an electronic journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These success stories with delegative democracy in Germany
have started to get noticed and studied internationally.
Articles in

recently covered the party&amp;rsquo;s attempt at a foothold in the US.
There are academic studies of the Pirate Party&amp;rsquo;s use of Liquid Democracy

Back in Germany,

at the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ma-politikmanagement.de&#34;&gt;NRW School of Governance&lt;/a&gt;
recently interviewed me as part of her thesis studying liquid democracy;
I look forward to seeing the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-to-next:c3ae62c8000679a68bb94bd778dd80b1&#34;&gt;Where To Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe strongly in the idea of delegative democracy,
regardless of what we decide to call it.
Participatory approaches to democracy are important because they address
a fundamental security flaw in representative democracy,
which in practice allows small groups of elite political insiders
to control and limit voting to choices
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Helen_Keller&#34;&gt;between Tweedledum and Tweedledee&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;
Delegation is important because it addresses
a basic scaling flaw of direct democracy,
which becomes a critical security flaw
once those members of a community with other demands
on their time and attention
are drowned out and driven away by a vocal minority
with the time and determination to do nothing but push their agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see delegation as just one of many improvements needed
to address scaling and security weaknesses
in traditional democratic processes, however.
I am concerned that current tools for delegative democracy
appear to be designed with limited attention to other security concerns.
The current tools depend on a single centralized server
that all users must simply trust,
and offer no cryptographic protections
either to ensure the integrity of the deliberation process,
or to offer privacy, anonymity, or coercion-resistance to voting users.
All of these issues and many others, if inadequately addressed,
could easily become &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; but equally critical security flaws
in the overall deliberative process
as it scales up and meets real-world adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this comment by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/uid:26945&#34;&gt;godix&lt;/a&gt; in a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/7/16/201556/896&#34;&gt;a kuro5hin discussion&lt;/a&gt;
to be both amusing and apt. [sic]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can easily see the following quotes if this idea ever took hold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Congradulations on your new high paying job at monolithic multinational
  corperation. Just a few forms to fill out and you&amp;rsquo;ll be earning three
  figures. First off is the tax form, next is your health insurance, then

  about politics really, but I&amp;rsquo;m famous. Thank you for giving me political
  power along with fame and wealth you mindless drones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No child/wife of mine is going to vote while they live in my house.  Sign
  it over or get the fuck out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, we know many of you are there are used to voting straight
  Republican/Democrat. To continue this fine tradition would you please sign
  your vote over to the DNC/GOP?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi, this is the President speaking. This nation decided I was qualified
  enough to run the free world but COngress is causing me problems. If you
  support me please sign over your vote. In return I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure I&amp;rsquo;m elected
  again and Congress isn&amp;rsquo;t. Thank you for your support.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi, you may know me, I&amp;rsquo;m Bill Gates. I&amp;rsquo;m getting sick of government
  investigations. The next one million people to sign their vote over to me
  gets a free copy of Windows 2045. This time we fixed the bugs. No,
  seriously, we did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ultimately need not only secure, scalable deliberative processes
such as delegative democracy,
but secure and scalable &lt;em&gt;implementations&lt;/em&gt; of those processes
with strong, decentralized integrity and privacy protections.
As I alluded to above,
building the technical infrastructure needed
integrity-protected, privacy- and anonymity-preserving communication &amp;mdash;
in a decentralized model where
no single person, organization, or server needs to be blindly trusted
&amp;mdash;
has been one of the key goals of my group&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/&#34;&gt;Dissent project&lt;/a&gt;
for the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we now have all the key cryptographic tools and protocols
we need to create secure implementations of delegative democracy.
To oversimplify things just a bit,
what remains is SMOP, a &amp;ldquo;small matter of programming.&amp;rdquo;
I would be happy to work with any talented coder/activists
interested in collaborating to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faculty size and growth in the top 20 Computer Science departments</title>
      <link>http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the &lt;a href=&#34;http://yaledailynews.com&#34;&gt;Yale Daily News&lt;/a&gt; ran
&lt;a href=&#34;http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/21/cs-department-struggles-for-faculty/&#34;&gt;an article on our CS department&amp;rsquo;s faculty shortage&lt;/a&gt;,
which generated
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/randy.katz/posts/10103594916315693&#34;&gt;some discussion among CS colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.
Yale&amp;rsquo;s CS faculty shortage is not really news:
for example,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/01/29/computer-science-dept-overworked-understaffed/&#34;&gt;another YDN article over a year ago&lt;/a&gt;
made basically the same point,
and that probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside Yale in particular, however,
it is interesting to notice some broader trends in CS department growth.
So here are a couple charts I recently put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first estimates the number of tenure-track faculty
in each of the top 20 CS departments, ordered accoring to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings&#34;&gt;US News&amp;rsquo;s current rankings&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Major caveat&lt;/em&gt;:
this faculty size data is completely unofficial and approximate,
based purely on the number of apparent ladder faculty members listed
on the respective CS department web sites.
Obvious potential sources of error include, for example,
faculty positions that are split across departments
but not clearly labeled as &amp;ldquo;adjunct&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;courtesy&amp;rdquo; appointments,
and combined CS-and-EE departments in which it is not always obvious
which faculty are more &amp;ldquo;CS&amp;rdquo; and which are more &amp;ldquo;EE&amp;rdquo;.
But these represent best guesses based on publicly available information
and are reasonably accurate to the best of my knowledge.
The &lt;a href=&#34;http://cra.org/&#34;&gt;CRA&lt;/a&gt; folks who put together the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cra.org/resources/taulbee/&#34;&gt;Taulbee Survey&lt;/a&gt;
probably have better and more &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; data,
but I don&amp;rsquo;t have that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth-charts/size-chart.svg&#34; style=&#34;width:40em&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the orange line indicates across the left half of the chart indicates,
CS departments in the top 10 appear to average about 67 ladder faculty,
with Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Georgia Tech being by far the largest,
and Princeton being the smallest of the top-10 at around 35 faculty.
As the yellow line on the right side indicates,
departments in the &amp;ldquo;next 10&amp;rdquo; category
appear to average around 39 ladder faculty each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is likely to be much of a surprise
to anyone familiar with CS academia.
What is more interesting is to look at the relative faculty growth
over the past decade, broken down the same way below.
The baseline numbers are derived from
the corresponding CS department home pages
as captured by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/index.php&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;
around September 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://bford.github.io/2014/10/22/cs-growth-charts/growth-chart.svg&#34; style=&#34;width:40em&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average growth of the CS departments currently in the top 10
is a relatively modest 8% since 2004.
My sense is that most if not all of these top-10 departments
have been hiring aggressively and more-or-less continuously
over the past decade, but mainly just filling the vacancies regularly created
as faculty get sucked away to industry positions or startups.
But these departments haven&amp;rsquo;t needed to grow &amp;ldquo;much&amp;rdquo; because, hey,
they&amp;rsquo;re already on top of the heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the picture for the &amp;ldquo;next 10&amp;rdquo; category looks interestingly different,
in which faculty size growth over the past decade
appears to have been around 21% on average.
Unless I&amp;rsquo;m mistaken,
USC in particular has nearly doubled in size over this period,
and a majority of departments in this category grew at least 20%.
Might we say these are the departments &amp;ldquo;bucking for the top 10&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all just for what it&amp;rsquo;s worth; no warranties yadda yadda.
Comments or corrections of any inaccuracies are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
