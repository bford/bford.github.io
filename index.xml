      <title>So They&#39;re Selling You a Blockchain</title>

      <description>Blockchain is certainly one of the hot technology topics today. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s probably in part a hype bubble &amp;ndash; but from my perspective as a long-time researcher in decentralized systems I believe there is also a lot of potential value in the concept, which is why my DEDIS lab at EPFL has been investing years of effort in building next generation blockchain architectures. I also believe the value of the blockchain concept is relatively independent of the unpredictable and scam-riddled financial market for cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>International Scientific Conferences Must Leave the U.S.</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2018/06/27/muslim-ban/</link>

      <description>So the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld Trump&amp;rsquo;s so-called &amp;ldquo;travel ban&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; more honestly labeled a Muslim ban. More precisely, it is a ban on people from Muslim-majority countries not hosting Trump business properties (see map and fact check).
Where to Hold Conferences? This development naturally and rightfully raises again to prominence the question of where responsible scientists should hold their international conferences. We may soon see renewed calls to boycott US-based conferences, in solidarity with the many scientists around the world who can no longer attend conferences held in the U.</description>

      <description>For the benefit those visiting but not yet familiar with EPFL, Lausanne, or other parts of the Lake Geneva Region, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a quick summary of some of my personal favorite places and sights in the area. This is completely my personal perspective; I make no pretense at being objective or unbiased here and am not trying to write a proper travel guide. But with that in mind, I hope you might find something interesting here.</description>

      <title>Secure, Scalable Proof-of-Stake Blockchains</title>

      <description>Proof-of-What? Currently-deployed permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on proof-of-work (PoW) to distribute both the computational networking costs, and the financial rewards, of maintaining and extending the blockchain. In proof-of-work systems, participating miners race (&amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;) to compute solutions to cryptographic puzzles. These puzzles effectively act like self-printed lottery tickets, in that a miniscule fraction of these proof-of-work solutions may be easily verified by anyone as &amp;ldquo;winning&amp;rdquo; the lucky miner the right to add one block to the blockchain and collect associated rewards.</description>

      <title>How Do You Know It&#39;s On the Blockchain? With a SkipChain.</title>

      <description>A blockchain, or distributed ledger, is a log maintained collectively by a distributed group of participants who agree on and record transactions without relying for security on any single trusted party. While initially popularized by Bitcoin and its derivatives, the blockchain abstraction is not specific to currencies, and there is exploding industry interest in many non-currency uses.
 
Many of these diverse use-cases, however, require users to be able to verify whether or not some transaction has been committed to a blockchain.</description>

      <description>This blog post is a transcript of my opening remarks on the panel &amp;ldquo;Restoring Personal Privacy without Compromising National Security&amp;rdquo; at the 50 Years of the ACM Turing Award Celebration. 
We now live in a world in which the rules coded into the technology we use plays as important a role in governing our lives as the formal laws written in the public law books. Code is law already, for better or worse.</description>

      <title>Selfish Mining in Bitcoin and ByzCoin</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2016/xx/xx/selfish/</link>

      <description>XXX intro
summary of selfish mining
selfish mining as a transparency problem: you get to build on a blockchain head you haven&amp;rsquo;t published.
same as transparency problem in Apple FBI case for example; that&amp;rsquo;s what CoSi is for.
solution: any keyblock you build on is collectively signed, and the next block&amp;rsquo;s hash covers the last block&amp;rsquo;s signature.
if you withhold a block, you can&amp;rsquo;t get a collective signature on it; without that collective signature, you can&amp;rsquo;t secretly mine a next block on top of it.</description>

      <title>Untangling Mining Incentives in Bitcoin and ByzCoin</title>
      <link>https://bford.info/2016/10/25/mining/</link>

      <description>--  
As the first widely-deployed cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has proven hugely successful and inspired a blockchain fever (or is it a bubble?). Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s security and economic assumptions are showing significant fractures, however. Following previously-identified selfish mining and stubborn mining attacks, new research from Princeton being presented at CCS identifies further incentive weaknesses that appear as transaction fees supplant block rewards as the primary incentive for mining.
In short, miners motivated by transaction fees have even greater incentive to deviate strategically from the standard Bitcoin protocol in selfish and potentially destructive ways.</description>

      <description>This post originally appeared on the Freedom to Tinker blog by the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. 
The Apple versus FBI showdown has quickly become a crucial flashpoint of the &amp;ldquo;new Crypto War.&amp;rdquo; On February 16 the FBI invoked the All Writs Act of 1789, a catch-all authority for assistance of law enforcement, demanding that Apple create a custom version of its iOS to help the FBI decrypt an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.</description>

      <description>{{ page.title }} Interesting features:
 An abstract group arithmetic framework for public-key cryptography based on the discrete logarithm problem.
 Several alternative concrete instantiations of this abstract group arithmetic framework, based on the NIST elliptic curve implementations in the Go standard library and in the OpenSSL crypto library, and implementations of both generic Edwards curves and an adaptation of Adam Langley&amp;rsquo;s Ed25519-curve-specific optimized group arithmetic code to the abstract group API.</description>

      <description>{{ page.title }} To my knowledge there are currently only two fundamentally distinct approaches to achieving strong anonymity online, and the same legendary computing figure, David Chaum, pioneered both. His first approach, mixes, relay messages over multi-hop paths around the network to obscure their source and destinations. State-of-the-art deployed anonymity systems such as Tor are highly evolved and performance-optimized variants of this basic relaying idea.
Chaum&amp;rsquo;s second approach, dining cryptographers, instead uses information-coding principles to hide the sender of a message among a group of nodes all of whom seem to be spewing gibberish at once.</description>

      <description>On Monday the EFF, together with a &amp;ldquo;Nameless Coalition&amp;rdquo; of like-minded groups, escalated the backlash against Facebook&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;real names&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;authentic identities&amp;rdquo; policy with an open letter urging Facebook to end this policy like Google Plus did last year. Facebook&amp;rsquo;s response cites concerns about pseudonyms helping to hide &amp;ldquo;terrorist organizations&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;school bullies&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;criminal behavior.&amp;rdquo;
While I support anonymity and have spent years working to strengthen it, terrorist fearmongering aside, Facebook is right that anonymity is often abused.</description>

      <title>Delegative Democracy Revisited</title>

      <description>Over a decade ago I wrote up some ideas I called &amp;ldquo;Delegative Democracy,&amp;rdquo; which has also become known as &amp;ldquo;Liquid Democracy.&amp;rdquo; My draft paper from 2002 took a first stab at laying out the general idea, though I never finished or tried to publish it. Since a lot has happened in this space since then, and I get regular inquiries about it, I thought it was high time to revisit the idea and review more recent developments.</description>

      <title>Faculty size and growth in the top 20 Computer Science departments</title>

      <description>Yesterday the Yale Daily News ran an article on our CS department&amp;rsquo;s faculty shortage, which generated some discussion among CS colleagues. Yale&amp;rsquo;s CS faculty shortage is not really news: for example, another YDN article over a year ago made basically the same point, and that probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first.
Setting aside Yale in particular, however, it is interesting to notice some broader trends in CS department growth. So here are a couple charts I recently put together.</description>

      <description>For another thing, I’m personally not a big believer in the practical value of the asynchronous model anyway. I know I’m at odds here with most people with a theory/algorithms background; reasonable people may differ. :) Almost every practical distributed system that ever actually gets deployed has timeouts and such buried in it here, there, everywhere. User-experience expectations are synchronous, not asynchronous: even if the underlying protocol is in principle perfectly capable of tolerating arbitrarily-long adversary-controlled propagation delays among honest nodes, the real users relying on the system are going to start complaining rather soon after the expected/normal amount of transaction time elapses.</description>

      <description>Hillary Clinton&amp;rsquo;s [electoral college defeat]() has provoked many questions about how so many Americans could have choosen a [misogynistic](), [xenophobic](), [pathologically lying](), [authoritarian]() [ideologue]() as their next President &amp;ndash; and one of many targets of their blame is [social media](). Compounding its [polarizing &amp;ldquo;echo chamber&amp;rdquo; effect](), online discussions were tarnished with [deliberate misinformation](), including [incorrect instructions on how to vote](). But is the solution for social media companies like Facebook to ``do a better job&amp;rdquo; at curating the world&amp;rsquo;s content to suppress out false or hateful speech?</description>
