<h1>Space access in the post-Columbia world</h1>
<h2>A Letter to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts</h2>
</center>

Dear Senator Kerry,

<p>
As one of your constituents, I grieve with the rest of the nation for the loss 
of the space shuttle Columbia and its crew, and want to thank you for 
continuing to show your support for the space program despite this tragedy.  
I fully agree with and support the points you made in your statement of 
February 4.  At the same time, however, we must take an honest look at the 
deficiencies in the current space program and take this opportunity to 
re-evaluate its direction and priorities.

<p>
The shuttles were revolutionary and inspiring technology in their time, but 
they are now outdated, overly expensive to maintain and fly, and increasingly 
perceived as unsafe.  Other methods of human space transport NASA is 
considering or working on, such as traditional rocket-based capsules or the 
new "orbital space plane," are merely stop-gap measures that will not be 
qualitatively cheaper or safer, and will certainly not capture the public's 
imagination or earn its widespread interest and support.  They will not make 
space any more accessible to the public, nor will they help us get any 
farther than Earth's orbit.  Robotic missions to other parts of the solar 
system have become humdrum at best.  ("Wow, pretty pictures.  Still no signs 
of life?  What a surprise.")  Not to say that NASA's current projects aren't 
useful or valuable - they are - but they are all (rather expensive) baby 
steps.  It is high time we took aim for another "giant leap."

<p>
There is one project that could both capture the public's imagination and 
truly revolutionize our access to space by making it many orders of magnitude 
cheaper and safer: a space elevator.  Previously thought impossibly 
far-fetched, with recent advances in carbon nanotube (CNT) technology space 
elevators have become eminently feasible and could be built and deployed in 
fifteen years or less.  A space elevator would immediately reduce the cost of 
space launch from $10,000-$40,000 per pound to around $200/lb.  The cost 
would continue to decrease rapidly thereafter, because unlike rocket- and 
aircraft-based technologies involving large fixed per-mission costs for fuel 
and othe expendable resources, the primary costs of a space elevator would be 
in its engineering (a largely one-time cost) and manufacturing (a cost 
subject to economies of scale).  Unlike space capsules and space planes, 
which must withstand tremendous mechanical forces and temperatures during 
every launch and reentry, a "climber" for a space elevator would move at a 
relatively constant and leisurely 120mi/hr - straight up - and hence would be 
much simpler, more reliable, and safer.  Moreover, a space elevator could 
lift cargo and humans to <i>any</i> Earth orbit, low or high, and to slingshot 
spacecraft economically to the moon or other parts of the solar system.

<p>
Can you think of any other feasible project that could better inspire the 
public to rally behind the space program, than the prospect of establishing a 
direct <i>physical</i> connection to space -
a 60,000-mile long vertical railroad 
- that would open up space exploration to the people in the same way that the 
early railroads opened up the American frontiers?

<p>
At least one serious undertaking to design and build a space elevator is 
already underway.  High Lift Systems (http://www.highliftsystems.com/) has 
completed preliminary NASA-funded feasability studies, and is already in 
contact with Congressman Norm Dicks and other influential members of 
government, so you may well already be aware of them.  I am not affiliated 
with High Lift Systems myself in any way, although I strongly believe in the 
project and intend to invest in it in the future if opportunity permits.  My 
goal with this letter is merely to bring the project to your attention, and 
to urge you to support it in any way possible.  The project could be fully 
funded out of a fraction of NASA's yearly budget, at substantially less than 
the current cost of maintaining and flying the space shuttles.  Even if a 
space elevator project still seems risky and far-fetched, given the 
overwhelming potential payoff for success,
can the U.S. afford <i>not</i> to make 
its development a top priority?  What would the long-term consequences be for 
the US's position of world leadership if, say, Europe or China was first to 
develop and deploy inexpensive access to space?

<p>
Thank you for your time and consideration.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Bryan Ford<br>
